There was no record of a request to adjourn the hearing. As a result, the hearing proceeded with only the Landlord's evidence.\n  Determinations: \n1.         As explained below, the Landlord has proven on a balance of probabilities the grounds for termination of the tenancy the application. Therefore, the tenancy is terminated as of May 23, 2023.\n2.         The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.\n  File Number: LTB-L-076368-22\n    3.         On October 15, 2021, the Landlord gave the Tenant an N7 notice of termination The notice alleges that the Tenant substantially interfered by threatening and harassing other tenants on multiple different dates. It also alleges the Tenant is the source of loud noise and racist language, as well as interrupting or interfering with other tenants\u2019 sleep.  \n  4.         The Landlord provided multiple letters from five other tenants that supported and documented threats and verbal and physical abuse to themselves and their pets. I accept this hearsay evidence, which went unchallenged, and find that:\n-On October 15, 2021 the Tenant harassed, verbally abused and threatening to kill his housemate.\n-On October 12, 2021 the Tenant harassed his neighbour and frightened him. \n-On October 11, the Tenant continued to make loud noises in his unit and disturbed other tenants in the residential complex. \n5.         I find that the Landlord has proved beyond the balance of probabilities that the Tenant impaired the safety of the Landlord and other tenants in the residential complex. \n6.         The Landlord incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.\n7.         There is no last month's rent deposit.\n8.

On August 25, 2021, the Landlord gave the Tenant an N5 notice of termination. The notice of termination contains the following allegations: The Tenant has piled garbage on the balcony leading to \u201chorrific smells\u201d and a \u201cstink\u201d that permeates through the entire residential complex and substantially interferes with the Landlord and other tenants\u2019 rights in the residential complex. \n  File Number: LTB-L-076371-22(EAL-98422-21)\n  2.        I accept the Landlord\u2019s evidence that the Tenant did not stop the conduct or activity within seven days after receiving the N5 notice of termination. Therefore, the Tenant did not void the N5 notice of termination in accordance with s.64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \u2018Act\u2019). \n3.        As explained below, the Landlord has proven on a balance of probabilities the grounds for termination of the tenancy the claim for compensation in the application.\n4.        The Landlord testified and provided the Board with photographs of garbage piled on the Tenant\u2019s balcony from the period of December 2020 to today\u2019s date. The Landlord\u2019s attempts to discuss the issue with the Tenant have been met with no response or slammed doors.  \n5.

The Landlord seek $1000.00 in damages to clean the balcony and replace a damaged wall installed hand sanitizer that the Tenant broke.  \n7.

Therefore, the tenancy is terminated and the Tenant must pay $1000.00 in damages to clean the garbage and replace the broken wall hand sanitizer.\n9.        The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed. \n10.

Your new file number is LTB-L-073444-22.\n  Homestead Land Holdings Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Virginia Larsson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard by videoconference on October 26, 2022.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, Kimberly Adams, the Tenant, and the Tenant\u2019s representative, John Done attended the hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to October 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 6, 2021.\n  2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,427.66 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.\n  3.     The Tenant paid $14,490.00 after the application was filed.\n  4.     The Tenant\u2019s representative took the position that the Landlord is holding a last month\u2019s rent deposit that is greater than the current rent amount. The Landlord\u2019s representative told the Board that the rent decreased as a result of cancelling the cost of storage and that represents the amount still being held by the Landlord. I find that this is not grounds\n\n  to dismiss the Landlord\u2019s application. The Tenant can seek to resolve this by filing her own application with the Board.\n  5.     The Tenant\u2019s representative also submitted that the N4 should be deemed invalid because it fails to set out the amount of rent due pursuant to subsection 59 (2) of the Act. He stated that the N4 misrepresents the rent which the Tenant paid during June and July 2021.\n  6.     At the hearing the Tenant\u2019s representative walked us through the ledger which represented the amount of rent charged, the amount of rent paid and the amount of rent due. While the Landlord may have allocated rent paid to previous arrears, the amount due on the N4 was in fact correct. Base of the information presented to me I find that the N4 served on the Tenant was valid.\n  7.     The Tenant testified that she was impacted by the pandemic and as a result fell behind on her rent payments. She told the Board that she was receiving CERB for a period of time, however, she is now working and intends to pay the outstanding arrears.\n  8.     In giving consideration to the Tenants circumstances, a delayed eviction would be appropriate. However, given the date this order is being issued, the Tenant has already had the benefit of additional time to seek financial assistance and/or alternative housing. Therefore, I find that a standard order is not unfair.\n  9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2023.\n  2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,546.31*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 10, 2023, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.\n  3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $45.64 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2023 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.\n  4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 21, 2023, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2023 at 5.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n\n  6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 21, 2023, then starting January 22, 2023, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n  7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2023.\n  8.     If, on or before January 21, 2023, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,352.70** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n  9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 22, 2023 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.\n      January 10, 2023 Date Issued\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n    If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.\n  In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 22, 2023 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.\n  *           Refer to section A on the attached Summary of Calculations.\n**         Refer to section B on the attached Summary of Calculations.\n\nSchedule 1 SUMMARY OF CALCULATIONS\n  File Number: EAL-98572-21\n  A.

The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  This application was resolved by order EAL-95828-21 issued on November 23, 2021. On December 23, 20221, the Landlord requested a review of the order.\nOn March 4, 2022, the Board heard the Landlord\u2019s request for review. On this date, only the Landlord attend the hearing. The Tenants did not attend and were not represented.\n  On May 10, 2022, the Board issued order EAL-95828-21-RV granting the Landlord\u2019s request for review and their L2 application.\n  On June 8, 2022, the Tenants filed a request to review the order EAL-95828-21-RV alleging they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing and that the order contains serious error.\n  A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  Were the Tenants reasonably able to participate in the hearing?\n  1.        In the request, the Tenants submit that they did not attend the hearing because they were told by Tenant Duty Counsel that they did not have to attend. The Tenants submit that\n\n  Tenant Duty Counsel told them this because the Landlord\u2019s application was for eviction and the Tenants had already vacated the rental unit.\n  2.        The Tenants\u2019 submissions clearly indicate that they were aware of the Board hearing, and they chose not to attend. The Tenants claim they did not attend the hearing because of legal advice they received, despite indicating in their request to review that they had issues they wanted addressed at the hearing. The fact the Tenants may not have received good legal advice with respect to their attendance at the hearing is not an error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding. Neither is it a reason for not being reasonably able to participate in the hearing.\n  3.        Based on the submissions in the request, I am satisfied the Tenants were reasonably able to participate in the hearing. I say this because the Tenants confirm knowing about the hearing and did not attend. In my view, this demonstrates a lack of due diligence on the part of the Tenants. A lack of exercising due diligence is not a reason for which a request to review an order would be granted. My findings are in keeping with the guidance of the Court in Q Res IV Operating GP Inc. v. Berezovs\u2019ka, 2017 ONSC 5541 CanLII (Div. Ct.) paragraph 8 which states:\n  If parties are not diligent in dealing with legal proceedings then they cannot demand that a Tribunal waste its resources by rehearing matters a second time. To allow this would undermine the ability of the administration of justice to deliver timely, cost-effective and final orders.\n  4.        Based on the above, the Tenants are not entitled to have the Landlord\u2019s application re- heard because they failed to exercise due diligence. Therefore, the request to review based on the Tenants\u2019 allegation that they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing, is denied.\n  Is there a serious error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding?\n  5.        In the request, the Tenants make submissions in support of their position with respect to the Landlord\u2019s application. The Tenants allege the Member made their decision based on misleading evidence and lies submitted by the Landlord. The Tenants further alleged that the Landlord never paid them compensation equal to one month\u2019s rent as required for having served them an N12 Notice of Termination (\u2018N12 notice\u2019).\n  6.        I have reviewed the Board\u2019s record and the order. In doing so, I note that in the Landlord\u2019s evidence package there is supporting documentation that compensation was paid to the Tenants with respect to the N12 notice. If the Tenants wanted to challenge the Landlord\u2019s evidence on this point, then the Tenants should have attended the hearing to give their evidence on the issue.\n  7.        With respect to the Tenants submitting the Landlord mislead or lied to the Board, the opportunity for the Tenants to challenge the veracity of the Landlord\u2019s evidence was at the hearing and not in a request to review the order.\n\n  8.        A request to review is not an opportunity for a party to re-litigate or reargue their position in hopes of a more favorable outcome. Nor is it an opportunity to present evidence and submissions that could and should have been presented at the hearing.\n  9.        In the request to review, the Tenants do not identify any serious error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding. Given my finding, the Tenants\u2019 request to review the order, on the grounds of serious error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding, is denied.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.

As of 10:23 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with a notice of hearing by the Board.\n\n        Determinations:\n  L2 application: substantial interference, illegal act, and serious impairment of safety\n  1.     The residential complex is an apartment building.\n  2.     The Landlords served a Notice to End Your Tenancy for Interfering With others, Damage, or Overcrowding (\u2018N5 notice\u2019) and a Notice to End Your Tenancy for Illegal Acts (\u2018N6 notice\u2019) on the Tenant on August 03, 2021 by handling the documents to an adult person in the unit.\n  3.     The Landlords served a Notice to End your Tenancy for Causing Serious Problems in the Rental Unit or Residential Complex (\u2018N7 notice\u2019) on the Tenant on August 03, 2021 by handling the documents to an adult person in the unit.\n  Evidence pertaining to the allegations in the N5 and N6:\n  4.     The N5 notice alleged that the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlords\u2019 reasonable enjoyment of the premises. The N6 notice alleged that the Tenant engaged in illegal acts on the premises. The grounds for the N5 and N6 notices together with evidence adduced at the hearing included:\n  \u2022         Excessive noise from Tenant\u2019s guests, yelling and banging on the evening of July 08, 2021 and July 16, 2021.\n  \u2022         On June 23, 2020 a unit inspection found damages to the parquet flooring, missing bathroom door, kitchen doors, and broken vanity door.\n  \u2022         On April 14, 2020, a photograph evidence of the lobby showed the Tenant removing a delivered parcel which was later reported as stolen as it belongs to another tenant\n  \u2022         On July 8, 2021 a crack pipe was found outside Tenant\u2019s unit door, bag found outside the apartment door in the building hallway containing drug paraphernalia. The Police was called, and the bag was secured with a police report completed accordingly\n  5.     K.K., a HomePro Pest Control technician, testified at the hearing as a witness for the Landlord. K.K testified that on May 13, 2021 and June 18, 2021, he attended the complex to treat the unit for cockroaches. K.K testified that he was unable to treat the unit due to extreme sanitation issues.\n  6.     K.K testified that the unit was infested with cockroaches due to extreme sanitation issues. He testified that the unit was poorly managed with clothes and injection needles on floor.\n\n  As a result of the state of the unit, pest control treatments could not be carried out on that day. The photographic evidence is entirely consistent with K.K testimony.\n  7.     The N5 notice gave the Tenant an opportunity to void the notice by ceasing all her conducts complained of in the notice in the seven days after the notice was served; so, the voiding period was from August 26 to September 01, 2021.\n  8.     The N7 notice alleged that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety of another person and substantially interfered with the Landlords\u2019 reasonable enjoyment of the premises. The grounds for the N7 notice along with evidence adduced at the hearing included:\n  \u2022         All of the grounds set out in the N5 and N6 notices.\n\u2022         On July 17, 2021 Tenant\u2019s guest harassed tenant for not allowing them to gain access to the building.\n\u2022         Tenant approached tenant on July 18, 2021 for not letting her guests into the building\nLegislation and Analysis:\n  The L2/N5 Application - Tenant has Substantially Interfered with the Landlord\n  9.     The N5 notice was served pursuant to sections 62 and 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (\u2018the Act\u2019). Section 62 sets out that a landlord can give a notice of termination if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a guest of the tenant wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit.\n  10.  Section 64 sets out that a landlord can give a notice of termination if the conduct of the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.\n  11.  The Tenant has an obligation under section 33 of the Act to maintain the rental unit in a state of \u201cordinary cleanliness\u201d.\n  12.  I accept the uncontested testimony of the Landlord\u2019s witness Deanna Blackwood and find that the Landlord proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant has substantially\ninterfered with the Landlord\u2019s lawful rights, privileges and interests by failing to maintain the rental unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness, such that the Landlord\u2019s was unable to perform necessary pest control treatments.\n  13.  I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant did not void the substantial interference claim or the damages claim set out in the N5 notice. The state of the Tenant\u2019s unit showed little or no improvement when the Landlord re-inspected it on September 01, 2021, the last day of the void period and to date the unit is not in a state of ordinary cleanliness. Therefore, the Landlord was entitled to file the L2 application for eviction of the Tenant.\n\n      14.  Regarding Tenant\u2019s alleged stealing delivered package from the lobby, yelling, and harassing tenant for denying her guest building entrance, there was no evidence establishing that the alleged acts seriously impaired the safety of any person.\n  15.  Re File No. TSL-19235-11, 2011 LNONLTB 2109 (Ont. L.T.B.) illustrates the strict requirement under Section 66 of the Act. In that matter, the Board held that threats made to a security guard did not constitute serious impairment of safety. In paragraph 12, the Board stated: \u201cVerbal harassment and threats alone rarely constitute a serious impairment of safety to another person\u201d.\n  16.  In Re File No. SWL-35940 [2002] O.R.H.T.D. No. 146 (O.R.H.T.), the Board held the\ntenant\u2019s actions, i.e., swearing at the landlord and acting inappropriately, while they made the landlord afraid, did not constitute serious impairment of safety. The adjudicator stated that any impairment of safety must be serious, and the Act was not intended to legislate good manners.\n  17.  In File No. SWL-01073, [1998] OR.H.T.D. No. 18, the Tribunal held that while many of the other tenant felt intimidated by the tenant, there was no objective evidence that anyone\u2019s safety was in real jeopardy. The Tribunal held that subjective fear was insufficient.\n  18.  In this case here, the Landlord asserted that on July 17 and 18, 2021, the Tenant swore at Tenants when they denied her guests access into the building. As illustrated in the abovementioned cases, the Tenant\u2019s actions on these dates do not \u201cconstitute serious impairment of other Tenants\u2019 safety\u201d.\n  19.  The Landlord did not meet the burden of proof. I am not satisfied that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety of another person or that they wilfully caused undue damage to the residential complex.\n  The L2/N6 Application\n  20.  Section 61(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') provides as follows:\n  61 (1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential complex.\n  21.  The Board\u2019s Interpretation Guideline 9 states that while the term illegal is not defined in the Act, it would include a serious violation of a federal, provincial or municipal law. This guideline also states that an illegal act will be serious if it has the potential to affect the character of the premises or to disturb the reasonable enjoyment of other tenant (Samuel Property Management Ltd. v. Nicholson 2002 CanLII 45065 (ON CA), 2002 61 O.R. (3d) 470 C.A. at para. 28)\n  22.  The Landlord\u2019s representative testified that the Tenant engaged in illegal acts on the premises as drug paraphernalia and needles were found in her unit, a crack pipe was\n\n  found outside of the unit door, and a bag of drug paraphernalia was also found outside the unit door. This was supported by photographic and documentary evidence.\n  23.  Despite these assertions, the Landlord\u2019s representative did not lead any satisfactory evidence to establish that the alleged illegal acts by the Tenant was for the purpose of trafficking contrary to section 61 of the RTA. Drug paraphernalia may be indicative of drug use, it does not automatically lead to a finding that Tenant or someone living with the Tenant has committed an illegal act or is carrying on an illegal business at the residential complex.\n  The L2/N7 Application - Serious Impairment of Safety\n  24.  Section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \u201cAct\u201d), establishes the \u201cimpairment of safety\u201d ground for termination. That provision states:\n  A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if,\n  (a)   An act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and\n  (b)   The act or omission occurs in the residential complex.\n  25.  Based on the Landlord\u2019s evidence, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the behaviour of Tenant meets the elements of section 66 of the Act.\n  Damage\n  26.  Subsection 89(1) of the Act gives the Board the authority to award a landlord damages. It provides as follows\n  \u201cA landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit\u201d.\n  27.  The Landlord relied upon an assessment provided by a contractor. He suggested to the Landlord the following:\n  \u2022         Install the missing Hardwood floors at the cost of $2,320.\n\u2022         Replace the Bathroom door at the cost of $225.00\n\u2022         Replace missing Kitchen and vanity doors at $780.00\n\u2022         Patch and Paint bathroom Ceiling at the cost of $600.00\n\n  28.  The photographs taken by the Landlord and submitted into evidence show missing wood to the hardwood floors, bathroom door, kitchen and vanity door, and bathroom ceiling.\n  29.  Given all these factors concerning the condition of the unit, I find that the evidence of the professional assessment of damages to the parquet flooring, missing bathroom door, kitchen doors, windows, and broken vanity door can be reasonably repaired and replaced at the cost of $4,435.25 (Total cost of work $3925.00 + HST of $510.25).\n  Section 83 Considerations\n  30.  The Board must determine whether, notwithstanding the breaches of the Act, it would be unfair in all the circumstances to grant relief from eviction.\n  31.  The Landlord requested a standard 11-day order terminating the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant, and evicting the Tenant, due to the extent of the damage caused to the rental unit and because the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlord\u2019s rights, privileges and interests. The Landlord testified that she is unaware of any circumstances of the Tenant that would cause me to delay or deny eviction of the Tenant.\n  32.  The Tenant did not attend the hearing to provide evidence regarding their circumstances and therefore there is no evidence before the Board for consideration.\n  33.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance\nwith subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act as the Tenant did not attend the hearing and there were no circumstances before me that would suggest that termination was unfair in this case.\nIt is ordered that:\n  1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 20, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 20, 2022.\n  2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,435.25, which represents the contractor\u2019s estimated amount of cost to repair damages to the hardwood floors, bathroom door, kitchen and vanity door, and bathroom ceiling on or before March 20, 2022\n  3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 21, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n\n  5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 20, 2022, then starting March 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n  6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 21, 2022.\n      March 09, 2022\nDate Issued                                                                     Percy Laryea\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n    If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.\n  In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on June 13, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.", "2022canlii137788": "  Order under Section 94\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-98436-21\n    In the matter of:\nB-4, 282 DONALD STREET OTTAWA ON K1K1M7\n  Between:\nJeannette Jarawan\nLandlord\n  and                                                                   \n    Sylvain Lalonde\nTenant\n      Jeannette Jarawan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sylvain Lalonde (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.

The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.\nDeterminations:\n  1.     The Landlord served the Tenants a Notice of Termination (N8 Notice) because the Tenants were persistently late in paying their rent.\n  2.     The N8 Notice served upon the Tenants by the Landlord lacks sufficient detail as required by subsection 43(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.\n  3.     The Ontario Divisional Court in Ball v.

The N8 Notice served upon the Tenants does not include the dates when the Tenants allegedly paid their rent late.\n  5.

The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.\n  2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1950.00 rent on or before February 1, 2022.\n  3.     The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.\n  4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $16,925.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-96834-21.

Pursuant to s.89 of the Act,\n  (1) A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant or former tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property if,\n\n  (a) while the tenant or former tenant is or was in possession of the rental unit, the tenant or former tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant or former tenant wilfully or negligently causes or caused undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex;\n  6.     In order for an application for compensation for damages made pursuant to subsection 89\n  (1)   of the Act to succeed, a landlord must establish the following:\na)  There was property damage to the rental unit or residential complex;\nb)  The damage is \u201cundue\u201d meaning that it is not normal wear and tear and it is not insignificant; and\nc)  The damage was a result of wilful or negligent conduct by the Tenant, occupant or guest.\n  7.     If all of these factors are met, then the Board can award the Landlord\u2019s the reasonable cost of repair, or the replacement cost if it is not reasonable for the damage to be repaired.\n  8.     Not all types of damage that may occur in a rental unit or residential complex will meet the test or requirement of section 89 of the Act.\n  9.     Some damage may not have any element of wilfulness or negligence and a landlord, as the property owner, will have to bear the cost of repairing that damage.\n  10.  Section 89 is clear and a plain language reading of the section establishes that the Tenant must have wilfully or negligently caused the damage.\n  11.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative said the Tenant was provided with a copy of the L2 application and details of the charge back. Submitted into evidence was an email dated November 9, 2020 where the Landlord writes to the Tenant about an exit inspection prior to the termination of tenancy and noting \u201cquite a bit of damage incurred inside of the unit that is not the result of wear and tear. Rather it is the result of the wilful negligent conduct of yourself and or/your guest.\u201d A reply to the email from the Tenant to the Landlord on November 12, 2020 states \u201cI will speak to my Ontario works worker.\u201d\n  12.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative reviewed sections 25 and 26 of the Lease as they pertain to the Tenant\u2019s obligation to maintain the unit in a good state of repair. Section J pertains to the Tenant(s) and/or guest(s) responsibility not to damage the unit wilfully or negligently. This was provided to the Tenant as per the November 9, 2020 email in paragraph 9. A copy of the Lease was submitted as evidence.\n  13.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative reviewed the before and after photos taken prior to tenancy and post tenancy as submitted into evidence.\n\n  14.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative argued that the Tenant, as a pre-condition to tenancy, signed an Incoming/Outgoing Residents Inspection Report on or about April 3, 2019. Submitted into evidence was a copy of the report and photos of the rental unit prior to the Tenant moving in. Also submitted into evidence was a list of the charge back costs should damage occur.\n  15.  In the L2 application, the Landlord is seeking $3899.31 as the cost to repair or replace the damaged property.\n  16.  On the date of the hearing, the Landlord\u2019s Representative, upon review of the evidence, requested to amend the application to include; the application filing fee, cost to replace the countertop and the cost to repair/replace the baseboard and flooring and painting. As detailed below, the revised total is significantly less than what was filed with the L2 application.\n  Kitchen Countertop\n  17.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative said that the counter tops had cut marks throughout the kitchen and that it was necessary to replace them at a cost of $300.00. Submitted as evidence was the Home Depot Invoice with a total cost for the countertop of $172.00. The Landlord believes it is reasonable for the Tenant to compensation the Landlord for the total cost of the countertop.\n  18.  Based on the evidence before me, I find that it is reasonable that the Tenant compensate the Landlord in the amount of $172.00 for the cost to replace the damaged counter tops. I find it is more likely than not that it was a result of negligence on the part of the Tenant that resulted in the damage to the countertop.\n  Flooring and Baseboards\n  19.  It was the position of the Landlord that the Tenant caused damage to the laminate flooring in the living room and dinning room and is seeking $2865.27 for replacement costs. The Landlord claims that the floors need to be replaced due to scratches and that all the floors need to be replaced for consistency throughout the rental unit. Additionally, the baseboards were damaged, possibly caused by the Tenant\u2019s rabbit, scratching and chewing and relieving itself in the unit. Before and after photos of the flooring and baseboards were submitted into evidence. The Landlord is seeking $650.00 for the area damaged to the flooring and baseboards for which the Tenant is responsible.\n  20.  Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I find the damage to the laminate flooring and baseboards to be undue property damage not a result of normal wear-an-tear. By allowing the Tenant\u2019s pet to relieve itself and scratch the flooring and baseboards in the\n\n  rental unit causing damage to the floor and baseboards, the Tenant has exhibited negligent conduct.\n  21.  Furthermore, I find that the quote of $650.00 to replace the flooring and baseboards for that section of the room where there is damage to be reasonable and this amount shall be awarded.\n  Paint\n  22.  The Landlord is seeking $297.08 for the cost of paint to repair the baseboards. The Sherwin-Williams invoice was submitted as evidence. When I questioned the Landlord\u2019s Representative on the cost of the baseboard paint, based on my experience, she suggested 25% of the total invoice as a reasonable cost to the Tenant. Accordingly, I find\n$74.27 to be a reasonable cost for paint to repair the area of baseboard damaged as a result of the Tenant\u2019s negligence.\n  23.  Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I am satisfied that the damages to the rental unit as described in paragraphs 17 to 22 is a result of the Tenant\u2019s wilful and/or negligent conduct. I say this based on the photographs presented by the Landlord that suggest damage beyond normal wear-and-tear. The Landlord\u2019s claim will be granted.\n  24.  This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.\nIt is ordered that:\n  1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $896.27, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage to the large section of flooring, baseboards and countertop.\n  2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  3.     The total amount owing under this order is $1082.27.\n  4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n  March 8, 2022\nDate Issued                                                                     Dana Wren\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\n\n  Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n    If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.", "2022canlii137882": "  Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-87949-19\n  In the matter of:\nxxx\n  Between:\nRB\nJB\nLandlords\n  and\n    HM\nTenant\n    RB and JB (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict HM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).\n  The Landlords applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also applied for an order for the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for undue damage to the rental unit (L2 application).\n  This application was heard via video conference on June 23, 2021. Only the Landlords attended the hearing.\nAt 9:23 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  L1 application:\n  1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective December 16, 2019.\n  2.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on February 14, 2020. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.\n  3.     The monthly rent was $1,175.00.\n  4.     The Tenant made no payments towards the rent after the application was filed.\n  5.     At the hearing, the Landlords acknowledged that there were clerical errors on the L1 update form submitted to the Board. Specifically, that new rent came due for January 1,\n\n  2020 and February 1, 2020 and not 2021. In addition, the filing fee cost was $190.00 and not $186.00.\n  6.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,175.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.\n  7.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 4, 2018 to December 16, 2019.\n  L2 application: Form N8 \u2013 Persistent Late Payment of Rent\n  8.     The Tenant vacated the unit. As a result, the hearing of the application to terminate the tenancy for persistent late payment of rent, is moot.\n  9.     At the hearing, the Landlords requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application.\n  10.  In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I consent to the withdrawal of the application.\n  L2 application: Damages\n  11.  The Landlord\u2019s L2 application for damages was amended to increase the compensation sought from $372.90 to $429.40. The amendment was granted as the Landlords provided the amended application to the Tenant prior to the hearing.\n  12.  The issue to be determined by the Board is whether the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit.\n  13.  The residential property is a two-storey house, with two bedrooms. The Tenant rented the entire house.\n  14.  The Landlords testified that the Tenant caused undue damage to a bedroom window. The Landlords stated that they were told by the Tenant that the Tenant\u2019s son was playing ball in the bedroom and broke the window\u2019s glass pane.\n  15.  The Landlords submitted into evidence photographs taken of the broken glass window.\n  16.  The Landlords testified that the window\u2019s glass could no be replaced, rather they had to replace the entire window, as it was less expensive to do so.\n  17.  The Landlords purchased and installed the new window. The Landlords claims the cost of the window was $380.00, plus $49.40 tax, for the total of $429.40.\n  18.  To be successful on a claim for damages the Landlords must prove on a balance of probabilities that the damage claimed is \u201cundue\u201d. There is no definition in the Act of \u201cundue\u201d, but it is fair to say that it means \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d or \u201cnot wear and tear caused by ordinary usage.\u201d The Landlords must also establish that the Tenant, wilfully or\n\n  negligently caused the damage. If the Landlords establishes undue damage which was caused wilfully or negligently then the Landlords must lead sufficient evidence to show what the reasonable cost to repair or replace.\n  19.  Based on the uncontested before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant, or an occupant of the unit, wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit. The Tenant\u2019s son caused the window\u2019s glass to break when he was playing with a ball in the bedroom.\n  20.  I find that the Landlords incurred the costs of $429.40 to replace the entire window and this is a reasonable cost.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.     The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated as of February 14, 2020, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.\n  2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,737.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 14, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.\n  3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords the amount of $429.40, which represents the reasonable cost incurred of replacing the damaged property.\n  4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  5.     The Tenant owes to the Landlords the total of $2,356.66.\n  6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing of $2,356.66 on or before March 18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n  7.

She cited the Ball vs Metro Capital case.  The Landlord did not make a submission regarding the sufficiency of the notice itself.  She relied upon the conversations which she had with the Tenant, and correspondence which she sent to the Board, but she had not sent a copy to the Tenant.  I ruled that the N7 Notice had sufficient detail about the alleged damage to the door; however, that part of the notice regarding the alleged alcohol abuse was vague in that it lacked details and dates of alleged incidents.  Therefore, evidence and testimony was heard about the alleged damages only. \n        Determinations \u2013 Landlord\u2019s Application:\n  1.        The Tenant caused undue damage to the rental unit by damaging the entrance door.  He attempted to repair the door; however, the repair job was not acceptable to the Landlord; therefore, she had the door replaced.\n2.        Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the Landlord has not met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, regarding the alleged substantial interference with her lawful right, privilege or interest; therefore, this part of the Landlord\u2019s application is dismissed.\n  Determinations \u2013 Tenant\u2019s Applications:\n1.         The Landlord has breached her maintenance responsibilities under section 20 of the Act by not maintaining the rental unit so that it is free of moisture build-up, resulting in mildew and mould growth.\n2.         The Landlord entered the rental unit illegally, on or about September 21, 2010, when she entered the rental unit to take photographs of the unit, without advising the Tenant of the true purpose of the entry.\n3.         The Landlord has substantially interfered with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by breaching his privacy, and by refusing to correct the moisture problem, as advised by the Public Health Unit.\n4.         The Landlord has harassed the Tenant by requiring him to pay his rent before it is due.\n    It is ordered that:\n  1.        The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $323.70, which represents the reasonable costs of replacing the damaged door.\n2.        The Tenant shall also pay $170.00 to the Landlord for the cost of filing the Landlord\u2019s application.\n3.        The Landlord shall pay $45.00 to the Tenant for the cost of filing the Tenant\u2019s applications.\n4.        The Landlord shall also pay a lump sum rent abatement of $147.00 for breaching her maintenance responsibilities.\n5.        The Landlord shall also pay a lump sum rent abatement of $245.00 for substantially interfering with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit, harassing and obstructing the Tenant, and illegally entering the rental unit.\n6.        The amount owing by the Landlord to the Tenant shall be offset against the amount owing by the Tenant to the Landlord.  The Tenant owes $56.70 to the Landlord.\n7.        If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before November 30, 2010, he will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from December 1, 2010 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n8.        That part of the Landlord\u2019s application regarding the alleged interference by the Tenant with her lawful right, privilege or interest is dismissed.\n9.        The Landlord shall make the repairs necessary to the flooring and air moisture level in the rental unit, to ensure that it meets all health, safety and maintenance standards, by November 20, 2010.\n        November 10, 2010                                                        _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Lynn Neil\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa ON K1P6A9\n  If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.\n \nFile Number: EAL-09252-10\nAnd TET-07695-10\n  REASONS\n   \nReasons to Order EAL-09252-10 issued on November 10, 2010 by Lynn Neil.\n  D.A. (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict A.D.M. (the 'Tenant') because he, another occupant of the rental unit or someone he permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises, and because he or someone he permitted in the rental unit or residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord in a residential complex which has three or fewer residential units. The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage.  The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  A.D. (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that D.A. (the 'Landlord') harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with him; entered the rental unit illegally; and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant.  The Tenant also applied for an order determining that the Landlord had breached her maintenance responsibilities.\n  These applications were heard in Peterborough on November 2, 2010.\n  The Landlord and the Tenant, with his legal representative, L.C, attended the hearing.\n    Preliminary Issues:`\n  The Tenant vacated the rental unit approximately September 30, 2010; therefore, the Landlord was no longer seeking an order to evict the Tenant.  However, the Landlord had discovered additional damage to the rental unit after she filed the L2 application with the Board.  At the hearing, she was seeking over $1,000.00 in damages to the rental unit, plus lost rental income for the month of October 2010.  With the consent of the Tenant, the application was amended to hear evidence about the additional claim by the Landlord for damages.\n  With respect to the N7 Notice, the Tenant\u2019s legal representative submitted that the notice was defective because it lacked sufficient detail.  She cited the Ball vs Metro Capital case.  The Landlord did not make a submission regarding the sufficiency of the notice itself.  She relied upon the conversations which she had with the Tenant, and correspondence which she sent to the Board, but she had not sent a copy to the Tenant.  I ruled that the N7 Notice had sufficient detail about the alleged damage to the door; however, that part of the notice regarding the alleged alcohol abuse was vague in that it lacked details and dates of alleged incidents.  Therefore, evidence and testimony was heard about the alleged damages only. \n      Reasons:\n  The Landlord testified that three times in June 2010 the Tenant left his window open.  She claimed to have closed it three times from the outside.  On July 21, 2010 she did an inspection of the rental unit and noticed mould on top of the vinyl flooring and in the grooves.  She took a pail of Javex and removed the mould from the flooring.  She also claimed that the carpeting was damaged by mould and urine.\n  The Landlord introduced into evidence two undated and unsigned letters from allegedly previous tenants (Exhibits #2 and #3) to support her claim that previous tenants had no issues with the rental unit.  Exhibit #3 appears to have been part of a larger letter, from which one paragraph has been photocopied.  Since the authors of these letters were not present to be directly examined or cross examined, I have placed very little weight on these documents.\n  The Tenant claimed that the mould in the rental unit was due to improper air ventilation and circulation in the basement rental unit.  He denied that his leaving the window open had caused the moisture build-up and mould.  Moreover, he submitted that he needed some fresh air circulating in the rental unit.  The Landlord had not provided him with a dehumidifier as she had done for the previous tenant.  The Tenant attached to his application some photos showing that the outside window frame was damaged \u2013 there was paint peeling off the frame.  He also introduced into evidence a photo of the wall below the window in his rental unit, and there was no damage evident inside the rental unit.  He testified that the mould started to appear on the floor, away from the wall \u2013 not at the wall as the Landlord had stated.  He also stated that there was mould underneath the carpeting which had been laid directly on the concrete.  He also stated \u2013 and supported his testimony with photographic evidence \u2013 that there was mould in front of the kitchen cabinets, along the baseboard around the rental unit, and around the exterior and seams of the shower unit.  He stated that he first noticed mould shortly after moving into the rental unit, and he notified the Landlord on July 13, 2010.  He believes that there were refrigerator issues which account for some of the mould problem in the kitchen.  The Landlord cleaned the area around the refrigerator, and she also replaced the full sized refrigerator with a bar sized fridge.\n  The Peterborough Public Health Unit inspected the rental unit on August 16, 2010 (see Exhibit #4) and stated that the vinyl flooring and carpeting should not have been laid directly on the concrete.  The Landlord stated that she spoke with the inspector after receiving the letter, and the inspector supposedly gave her different advice from what is contained in the letter; however, the Landlord had no evidence to corroborate this claim.\n  Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant has not caused the mould damage, as claimed by the Landlord.  There were a number of contributing factors, including the laying of the carpet and vinyl directly on the concrete floor, and inadequate air ventilation in the rental unit which is located below grade, in the basement.  Therefore, this part of the Landlord\u2019s application is dismissed including the Landlord\u2019s claim for lost rental income.\n  The Tenant claimed in his T6 application that he had told the Landlord about the mould problem but she had failed to correct the problem.  Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord has breached her maintenance responsibilities under section 20 of the Act.  Therefore, I am awarding a rent abatement of 10% for the period July to September 2010.  Moreover, the Landlord has substantially interfered with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by accusing him of causing the problem, rather than finding the true source of the problem and addressing it properly.\n  The Tenant acknowledged that he damaged the entrance door on August 19, 2010 when he tried to no avail to unlock the door.  He than broke down the door in order to gain access to his rental unit.  He advised the Landlord by letter dated August 19, 2010 of the damage he had done.  The Tenant tried to repair the door, by buying a door and hiring a handyman to install the replacement door.  The Landlord was not satisfied, however, with the repair job.  She stated that the Tenant replaced the broken door with a used one that did not fit properly, and that damage was also done to the door frame. She introduced into evidence some photos which show that the repair job was probably inadequate as she claimed.  Although she observed the repair job in progress, she did not advise the Tenant that the finished work was not acceptable until about a week later.  The Landlord then purchased a new door ($261.54), and had it installed.  The new door needs to be painted, at an estimated cost for labour of $100.00.  This estimate seems excessively high, considering that her son will paint the door.  I am, therefore, allowing only $50.00 for labour, plus the cost of the door and paint, and the cost of two keys ($12.16), for a total damages award of $323.70.\n  With respect to the illegal entries, the Tenant stated that the Landlord told him that she had entered his rental unit once in June 2010 to close the window while he was away.  The Landlord denied this allegation at the hearing.  On September 21, 2010 approximately the Landlord entered the rental unit to take photographs.  She did not tell the Tenant the true reason for her entry when she gave him a handwritten note on September 20, 2010.  She only stated that she would be taking someone through to see the unit, which was available for rent, because the Tenant had given notice of his intention to terminate the tenancy October 1, 2010.  The notice provided by the Landlord on September 20, 2010 was not an adequate notice, because it provided false information about the reason for the entry; therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord has illegally entered the rental unit.\n  The Landlord collected the rent before the due date throughout the whole tenancy.  On April 21, 2010 she collected the rent for May 2010.  On May 19, 2010 she collected the rent for the months of June and July 2010.  On July 31, 2010 she collected the rent for August 2010.  She stated that she wanted the rent pre-paid because the Tenant was not working at the time.  However, the Landlord does not have the authority under the Act to require pre-payment of rent under any circumstances.\n  In addition the Landlord called the police, and sent the police to the home of the Tenant\u2019s mother.  The police were not sure why they had been called.  No charges were laid or warnings issued by the police.\n  I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord has harassed the Tenant by requiring him to pre-pay the rent, and by calling the police to complain about the Tenant without a legitimate cause.\n  The Landlord on numerous occasions called the mother of the Tenant when she had issues with the Tenant.  The Tenant introduced into evidence a handwritten list of dates when the Landlord had called his mother.  This list (Exhibit #1) was written by the Tenant\u2019s mother.  The Landlord did not deny having called the Tenant\u2019s mother on numerous occasions.   Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Landlord has substantially interfered with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.  She has breached his privacy by discussing issues in the tenancy with another person, without the explicit permission of the Tenant.\n  The Landlord also obstructed the Tenant by failing to provide an information package to the Tenant, as required by section 11 of the Act.\n  I am awarding a rent abatement of 10% for each month of the tenancy, because the Landlord has repeatedly breached the rights of the Tenant throughout the whole tenancy.  This rent abatement amounts to $245.00.\n  The Tenant had documentary evidence to support most of his testimony.  I have placed a medium weight on his testimony and evidence.  The Landlord, however, had very little documentary evidence or witnesses to corroborate her claims, with the exception of the damage to the door, for which the Tenant had readily admitted responsibility.  The Landlord did not seem to understand her responsibilities and rights under the Act, nor those of the Tenant.  She rationalized her actions (for example, calling the Tenant\u2019s mother about issues, entering the rental unit without proper notice of her intent to take photographs, collect the rent in advance, etc) and did not seem to understand or care that she had contravened the governing legislation.  She had no evidence to corroborate her testimony on some significant issues; for example, she claimed that when she spoke with the inspector of the Public Health Unit, the inspector told her information different from that contained in the letter of August 16, 2010.  I did not find the Landlord to be a credible witness, and I have placed a low weight on her testimony.\n  It should be noted that the Landlord has re-rented this rental unit to new tenants, but she has not replaced the flooring as directed by the Public Health Unit.  This should have been done before the new tenants moved in.  The Landlord should immediately take the necessary corrective action to ensure that this rental unit meets all health, safety and maintenance standards.   Proper flooring needs to be correctly installed.  Also the problem with the air moisture level must be investigated and corrected.\n      November 10, 2010                                                        _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Lynn Neil\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa ON K1P6A9\n ", "mould \u2014 enjoyment of the rental unit \u2014 door \u2014 rent \u2014 residential complex"], "2010canlii101046": ["  Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-05724-10\n      In the matter of:      [Address removed]\n      Between:                  [Landlord\u2019s name removed]                                                                        Landlord\n      and\n \n[Tenant(1)\u2019s name removed] [Tenant(2)\u2019s name removed]\n\nTenants\n\n  [Landlord\u2019s name removed] (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and\nevict [Tenant(1)\u2019s name removed] and [Tenant(2)\u2019s name removed] (the 'Tenants') because they, another occupant of the rental unit or someone they permitted in the residential complex have substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  This application was heard in Brockville on April 26, 2010.\n  The Landlord\u2019s Director, [Landlord Director\u2019s name removed] and the Landlord\u2019s Representative, [Landlord Representative\u2019s name removed] attended the hearing.\n  As a preliminary matter, the Landlord\u2019s Director testified that on April 18, 2010, the two Tenants told him that they were not attending the hearing on April 26, 2010 and that they would find a way to delay the process. The Landlord\u2019s Representative also mentioned that on December 22, 2009 the Tenants did not attend the Landlord\u2019s application for rental arrears and eviction and that on February 19, 2010 the Tenants did not attend their own request to review the Order emanating for the December 22, 2009 hearing.\n  I notified the Landlord\u2019s representative and the Landlord of my obligation under subsection 83(2)\nof the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \u2018Act\u2019) and asked whether there was any information to provide concerning why the eviction should be delayed or refused.  The Landlord\u2019s representative and the Landlord only provided information on the reasons why the Tenants should not be given any relief from eviction and did not provide any such information as to any reasons or circumstances why the Tenants should be granted relief from eviction.\n      Determinations:\n  1.   The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $800.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.\n\n    2.   Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from July 1, 2009 to\nApril 8, 2010.\n  3.   The Tenants did not correct the problem within the time period set out in the Notice of\nTermination.\n  4.   On June 30, 2009 the Tenants signed a lease agreement.\n  5.   Section 9 of the lease agreement states that the Tenants shall pay for the water.\n  6.   Section 11 of the lease agreement states that the Tenants \u201c shall enter into an agreement with the appropriate utility supplier prior to taking possession of the premises,\u2026..and to be responsible o this authority for all charges in relation to the supply of said utilities until the last day of the tenancy\u2026.\u201d\n  7.   Based on the Landlord\u2019s numerous invoices and letters from the Town of Gananogue there is no doubt that since July 1, 2009 to March 30, 2010 the Tenants did not enter into an agreement with the Town of Gananoque to pay the water for the rental unit.\n  8.   Because of the water account is still under the Landlord\u2019s name and the Town of Gananoque is threatening to cut off the water supply to the rental unit the Landlord\u2019s Director paid the outstanding amount of $1,342.29 in April 2010.\n  9.   Stanbar Properties v. Rooke (September 22, 2005) (Ont. Div. Ct), the court found that the tenant\u2019s refusal to comply with the condition to maintain property insurance constituted substantial interference with the landlord\u2019s lawful rights obtained under the lease agreement.\n  10. I find that the Tenants in this case are refusing to comply with the condition to enter in an agreement for the water supply with the Town of Gananoque, which is not prohibited by the RTA and the parties agreed to in the lease, have substantially interfered with the Landlord\u2019s lawful rights and privileges.\n  11. The Tenants have been aware of their responsibility to enter in an agreement for the water supplier since June 30, 2010 and they still have not acted even though the Tenants are aware that the water supply may be shut off by the Town of Gananoque and the hardship it is causing the Landlord.\n  12.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.\n        It is ordered that:\n  1.   The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.  The Tenants must move out of the rental unit on or before May 9, 2010.\n\n    2.   As of the date of this order, the amount the Landlord is holding for the rent deposit and the interest owing on the deposit exceeds the amount the Tenants owe for compensation by $286.97.\n  3.   The Landlord is authorized to offset from the amount the Landlord owes the Tenants the following amounts: $26.30 per day for compensation for the use of the unit from April 29,\n2010  to the date the Tenants  move out of the unit; and $170.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  4.

(EAL-11078-10)\n  And\n  SM (the 'Tenant') applied for an order determining that GB (the 'Landlord') has collected or retained money illegally by: a) not paying the Tenant the interest owing on the last month rent deposit: b) charging the Tenant illegal rent.  (EAT-11639-10)\n  These applications were heard in Pembroke on November 19, 2010.\n  The Landlord, the Tenant and the Tenant\u2019s Representative, AS attended the hearing.\n  REASONS:\n  The Tenant has been residing in one of the rental units of a two (2) unit residential complex since April 1, 2006.  The Tenant has been paying a monthly rent of $700.00 including hydro and heat until the end of January 2010. In the early part of 2010, the Landlord had the smart meters installed for the two rental units and asked the tenants of the two (2) rental units to pay the rent plus the hydro.  There was no notice of rent increase.\n  In early October 2010, the Tenant made the Landlord aware that he owed her the interest on her last month rent deposit and that she disagreed and opposed the payments of hydro.  On October 23, 2010, the Landlord served a notice of eviction to the Tenant because he wanted to move into the rental unit on January 1, 2011 with a post dated cheque for December 31, 2010, for the amount of $80.23, for the interest on the last month rent deposit.  On October 25, 2010, the Landlord filed an application with the Board. \n  Did the Landlord have the genuine intention to move into the rental unit at the time the Landlord served on the Tenant a notice of eviction?\n  In his affidavit filed with the Board the Landlord states \u201cfor the personal use and enjoyment for myself and my wife and children.\u201d\n  At the hearing, the Landlord testified that moving in the Tenant\u2019s rental unit is necessary to stabilize or improve his financial situation.  He also testified that the house that he presently resides in and owns with his spouse was never for sale or for rent.\n  The Landlord\u2019s testimony is contradictory.  I fail to understand how the Landlord\u2019s financial situation will improve if he is to live in the Tenant\u2019s rental unit and not sell or rent his other home.\n  Secondly, in early October 2010, the Tenant invoked her right to stop paying an illegal charge and on October 23, 2010 the Landlord replies with a notice of eviction..  Meanwhile, there is no dispute that the other tenant living in second rental unit is still paying the hydro bill since February 2010 without opposing the Landlord.  I find it more believable that the Landlord\u2019s application was brought forward because the Tenant has attempted to secure and enforce her legal rights.\n  For these reasons, I find on the balance of probability that the Landlord did not have the genuine intention to move into the Tenant\u2019s rental unit at the time the Landlord served on the Tenant the notice of termination (October 23, 2010) and the application(October 25, 2010).\n  Although, the Landlord claims that since the notice of eviction and the application has been served on the Tenant, he is now engaged in a trial separation.  This new element was not corroborated by any document or witness.  The Tenant should not be subjected to the Landlord\u2019s attempts at a separation.  I did turn my mind to this new element but it does not change my final decision.\n  Pursuant to section 204 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, I have ordered the conditions on the Landlord because they are necessary to reinstate the parties to their original contractual lease obligations and to provide closure to the issues.\n    December 1, 2010                                                           _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Gerald Naud\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa ON K1P6A9\n ", "rental unit \u2014 last month rent deposit \u2014 notice of eviction \u2014 hydro bill \u2014 paying"], "2010canlii79786": ["Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-11585-10\n       \nLPM (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict GM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard in Kingston on December 1, 2010.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, BL and the Tenant attended the hearing.

The Tenant also applied for an order determining that the Landlords have not repaired or maintained the rental unit or the residential complex and have not complied with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.\n  The Landlords have also applied for an order terminating the tenancy and evicting the Tenant and for collection of monies for wilful or negligent damage in the rental unit or in the residential complex. \n  These applications were heard together, in Ottawa, on December 9, 2010.\n  The Tenant, and the Landlords, attended the hearing.\n  The Tenant complains that there are several cracks in the cement floor of the garage. He goes further stating that this may cause the entire garage to collapse, and because it is attached to the house itself, it may cause the house to also collapse. There was no evidence that this is cause for any concern at all. This appears to be a common occurrence in most garages in the area in question. There was an inspection done of the property and there was no such concern about the garage or the attached house, by the inspectors.\n  The Tenant also complains that the fence in the backyard dividing the properties is going to fall and seriously injure someone or even cause the death of someone. A small part of the fence in question, which belongs to the neighbours and is beginning to lean a little, is certainly not in such bad shape as to cause any concern about actually falling down or of causing any safety concerns.\n  The Tenant also failed to produce any relevant evidence that would convince the Board that the Landlord\u2019s illegally entered the rental unit or caused any serious interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by the Tenant or by his family.\n  With respect to the Landlord\u2019s application, they were requesting that the tenancy be terminated and were also requesting payment of monies for damages in the rental unit. The damages were for cleaning (professionally) deep stains on the carpet on the stairway, and for priming and repainting the bedrooms, for a container of sealant for the driveway because the Tenant appears to have had a leaky radiator which stained the driveway. I find that these \u2018damages\u2019 are as the result of normal wear and tear in the rental unit. This is a 4 or 5 year tenancy, and the Tenant has already given proper notice to terminate the tenancy and return to Saudi Arabia, on or before December 31, 2010. The Tenant has undertaken to have the stairs cleaned with a professional steam cleaning machine and he has already cleaned all of the walls in the bedrooms, including any crayon/pencil marks on the closet doors or walls.       \n     Determinations:\n  1.        I find that the Landlords did not harass, obstruct, coerce, threaten or interfere with the Tenant, nor enter the rental unit illegally nor substantially interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of his was household.\n2.        I also find that that any of the damage outlined in the application by the Landlords was actually simple and reasonable wear and tear by the Tenant and his household. \n  It is ordered that:\n  1.

The Landlord\u2019s representative had summonsed one witness, RM, of the Ottawa Police Services, who attended and was the only witness. \n  The Landlord\u2019s Agent called only one witness RM to support her application for termination in this case. RM is a detective with the Ottawa Police Services, and has been with the OPS for some thirteen years, seven of those years working in the drug unit. He was the lead officer in the execution of a search warrant in the Tenant\u2019s rental unit where the Tenant has resided for about three years. The residential premises is an eight story apartment building with 117 rental units housing a variety of tenants, be they seniors, families or other individuals, both single and married. \n  This witness verbally laid out a detailed account of the raid by police and the items discovered and seized as a result. During this raid the police found, in pill bottles, 12 tablets of Oxycontin, 80 tablets of oxycontin on the Tenant\u2019s person, 98 tablets of methyl morphene, and at least 24 other tablets of oxycontin, as well as various amounts of ectasy and recindal, 2 digital scales, 2 cell phones, pepper spray and a fire arm holster.

The first was that the Landlord was a corporation. Convention had it, at one time, that a notice for Landlord\u2019s own occupation could not be given by a corporate Landlord. At issue here is whether there could be an exception for closely held corporations, given that section 202 of the Act states that in \u201c...making findings on an application, the Board shall ascertain the real substance of all transactions and activities.\u201d Divisional Court has now come down in favour of allowing a corporation to give notice in some circumstances.\n  On an appeal from the LTB, the Court stated:\n  Whether a sole shareholder can require possession of a rental property owned by a corporation for own use should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The consideration of this matter should include the nature of the shareholding and the discretion granted in section 202 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.\n  In the case at hand here there are two brothers who have formed a small holding company and who have each consented to the request. Both own equal shares of the company.\n  The Landlord\u2019s application to evict the Tenant is also found to have been made in \u2018good faith\u2019 in this instance.\n  The second issue was whether or not the Board was prepared to grant section 83 relief if the evidence was clear that it should do so.\n  With respect to this issue the Board is always prepared to consider all the circumstances in determining the award of relief to Landlords or Tenants, and especially in the case of the termination of a tenancy.   \n  Determinations:\n  1.

They explained that their circumstances have changed now that the Tenant KT is working and they would be able to respect a more reasonable plan to repay the arrears by April 2011 instead of February 2011 as in the original agreement.  They have three children with a fourth child on the way and would find it very difficult on the family to have to find a new home.\n  The Landlord was sceptical of the Tenants\u2019 ability to respect a new payment plan.\n  Determinations:\n  1.

The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting mediated settlement required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent.

The application under section 78 of the Act would normally have resulted in an ex parte order.\n5.

Order EAL-11865-10 issued on December 21, 2010, contains a serious error in law in the determination made by the Member.  The Landlord did not impose an air conditioning charge on the Tenant.  The Tenant signed the lease and initialled each page on October 10, 2006.  Paragraph 58 strictly prohibits the installation of an air conditioner when the Landlord provides the electricity unless permission is grant in writing.\n  2.        Starting in June 2008 the Landlord began posting written notices informing tenants that there would be an additional charge if they chose to install an air-conditioner for the summer months.  The tenants were informed that the seasonal charge would be $50.00.  This charge is allowed in the Residential Tenancies Act in section 123 of the Act and section 16 of the Regulation 516/06.\n  3.        I find there was a written agreement from the Landlord to allow tenants to install air-conditioners provided the tenants pay the reasonable cost of electricity.  By installing an air-conditioner a tenant is agreeing to pay the fee.\n  4.        The Tenant argues that he had installed an air-conditioner from the beginning of his tenancy and because he was not required to pay for the electricity prior to 2008 it was implied that this service was a part of the tenancy agreement.  Where a tenancy agreement strictly prohibits an activity or service and the agreement is signed by a tenant, a tenant cannot unilaterally breach that agreement and claim that the tenancy agreement has been amended because of those actions.  As an example, if a tenant has been hanging laundry on a balcony and that is prohibited, it does become an implied right to hang the laundry on the balcony.\n  5.

The matter was resolved by Order EAL-12316-10 issued on December 15, 2010.\nThe Tenant filed a motion to set aside order EAL-12316-10.\n  And\n  The Tenant applied for an order determining that the Landlords or the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent entered the rental unit illegally, substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenant or by a member of her household and withheld or deliberately interfered with the reasonable supply of a vital service, care service, or food that the Landlord is obligated to supply under the tenancy agreement (T-2 application).\n  These applications and this motion were heard together in Brockville on January 31, 2011.  The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.  The Tenant was represented by JK.   KG testified on behalf of the Tenant.\n  I notified the parties of my obligation under subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \u2018Act\u2019) and asked whether there was any information to provide concerning why the eviction should be delayed or refused. The Landlords did not provide any such information.\n  The Tenant argued that eviction should be refused as she did not agree to terminate the tenancy and that she is not in arrears of rent as the Landlords owe her money.\n  Issues raised by the Tenant at the hearing:\n  The Tenant decided to withdraw the portion of the application referring to illegal entry into the unit.\n  The Tenant alleged the following: that the Landlords reduced the floor space of her unit without providing her with the agreed upon compensation, that the Tenant was exposed to the dust and debris of the renovations in the unit above hers (shared ventilation) as well as the renovations related to the sectioning of her rental unit to reduce the floor space, that the exposure to the dust and debris made her sick with asthma, that the Landlords failed to provide heat from the primary source of heating (the furnace) to her unit in October 2010, that the Landlords failed to provide hot water during a four day period in August 2010, and that all of these issues contributed to substantially interference with her reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.\n  The Tenant requested compensation in the form of a rent rebate and also asked for compensation related to the Landlords making her sick with asthma.\n  Determinations:\n                      L-1 application\n1.        The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from November 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011.  Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective November 25, 2010.\n2.        Prior to any rent rebate, the Tenant owes $2,016.00 (this amount represents arrears and costs owed up to February 28, 2011).\n3.        The Tenant is entitled to a rebate of rent of $3,200.00 in compensation for the issues in the Tenant\u2019s application (see below).\n4.        The Landlords owe the Tenant $1,184.00 (rebate minus rent owed).\n                    L-3 application\n5.        I find that there was no meeting of the minds to terminate the tenancy.\n                    T-2 application\n6.        I find that the Tenant was paying $650.00 in monthly rent for the unit when the tenancy started in September of 2007.\n7.        I find that the ex-husband of the Landlord (PW) lent the Landlords the money to purchase the residential complex and was very influential in how the Landlords managed the residential complex and dealt with the Tenant.\n8.        I find that the Landlords reduced the Tenant\u2019s floor space by approximately 40% at least one year prior (December 2009) to the date the Tenant filed her application (December 3, 2010).\n9.        I find that the parties had initially agreed to reduce the rent by $200.00 per month with respect to the reduced floor space.\n10.   I find that the Landlords continued to charge the Tenant $650.00 in monthly rent after reducing the Tenant\u2019s floor space by approximately 40%.\n11.   I find that the Landlords were aware of the Tenant\u2019s issues with mental health (depression and suicide attempts).\n12.   I find that the Landlords played on the good will of the Tenant to delay compensating her (with reduced rent) for the reduced floor space and to eventually offer her insufficient alternate compensation.\n13.   I find that the Landlords and (PW)\u2019s ex-husband (Landlords\u2019 agent) only provided the Tenant with part of the full cable services she was promised (television, high speed internet, and internet phone service) as alternate compensation for the reduced floor space.\n14.   I find that the unreliable phone service (internet phone service shared with (PW)\u2019s ex-husband) supplied by the Landlords forced the Tenant to have to use pay phones at crucial times and substantially interfered with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.\n15.   I find that the Landlords have substantially interfered with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of her unit by reducing her floor space without providing proper compensation.\n16.   I find that it would be reasonable to provide the Tenant with a rent rebate of $3,000.00 ($200.00 per month from December 2009 to February 2011) with respect to the reduction of the Tenant\u2019s floor space.\n17.   I find it reasonable that a $200.00 monthly rebate should continue to be provided to the Tenant as long as the Tenant\u2019s floor space is reduced from the space that was allotted at the beginning of the tenancy.\n18.   I find that the Tenant was exposed to the dust and debris related to the renovation work that reduced the Tenant\u2019s floor space. I find that the Landlords failed to clean up the dust and debris until the end of December 2009, and that this lack of action on the part of the Landlords substantially interfered with the Tenant\u2019s reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit.\n19.   I find it reasonable to compensate the Tenant with a rent rebate of $200.00 for the month of December 2009 when the Tenant was exposed to the dust and debris.\n20.   The total rebate to the Tenant is $3,200.00.\n21.   I find that the Landlords or the Landlord\u2019s agent interfered with the reasonable supply of heat from the furnace to the Tenants\u2019 unit during the month of October 2010, and the supply of hot water for a four day period in August 2010.\n22.   I find that the Tenant did not substantiate the impact of the Landlords\u2019 interference with the supply of these vital services and did not request compensation for this issue.\n23.   I find that the Tenant failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the Landlords\u2019 actions were responsible for her illness.\n    It is ordered that:\n                      L-3 application\n1.        Order EAL-12316-10 issued on December 15, 2010, is set aside and cannot be enforced.\n                    L-1 and T-2 applications\n2.        The Landlords shall pay to the Tenant $1,184.00 which is the difference between the rent rebate of $3,200.00 awarded to the Tenant and the amount of $2,016.00 owed by the Tenant for arrears of rent and costs.\n3.        The Landlords shall pay the Tenant the full amount owing by February 27, 2011.\n4.        If the Landlords do not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by February 27, 2011, they will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from February 28, 2011 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n5.        If the Landlords do not pay the Tenant the full amount owing by February 27, 2011, the Tenant may recover this amount by deducting $450.00 from the rent each month staring March 1, 2011 until the full amount has been recovered.\n6.        Starting March 1, 2011, the Landlords shall provide the Tenant with an ongoing monthly rent rebate of $200.00 for as long as the Tenant\u2019s floor space is reduced from the space that was allotted at the beginning of the tenancy.\n7.

The Landlords and the Tenants, and their respective Counsels, attended the hearing.\n    The Landlords failed to demonstrate that they met the requirements of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the\u2019Act\u2019) pursuant to section 48.  The Landlords also failed to demonstrate that they were making this application \u2018in good faith\u2019 because the Landlords\u2019 daughter wanted to use this rental unit only occasionally. The daughter lives with her husband and another child (a son) in the family home within this city. It is most unlikely that the Landlord\u2019s daughter would be intending to use this rental unit as her main residence, based on the evidence she provided with respect to not leaving her husband and son alone in the family home. In other words this arrangement would be use of the rental unit on an intermittent or casual basis. The daughter also gave evidence that she was returning to work after a maternity leave and she wanted or needed her parents to babysit the younger child. She also stated that she would be staying with her parents four or five days a week. This is not the intention of this section of the Act. No matter which way we look at this application, it always returns to the fact that his would not be the primary residence of the daughter and her newborn daughter, and also she would not be residing in the rental unit on a full-time basis.\n  The Tenants were insistent on the fact that the Landlords were not acting in good faith, because this was a basement unit and the female Landlord (mother of the daughter who wants to move in) was not even able to climb the necessary stairs (due to a disability) to take care of the baby in the rental unit, during the time that the daughter was at work. \nThe Landlords invoked, at one point in the hearing, the fact that this is a cultural trait. It was a cultural thing that people from the Phillipines tended to have their children looked after by other family Members when it is not possible to be present themselves. I find that that is a normal way of life for most other cultural minorities. The Landlords already occupy part of the residential complex, and have ample room/space to babysit their grandchild on a regular basis.\n  A commentator on the Act sets out that \u201cthe test of good faith under section 48 is a genuine intention to occupy the premises (the rental unit), not the reasonableness of the Landlord\u2019s proposal.\u201d I find that, in this case, there is no genuine intention to occupy this rental unit on a full time basis. Consequently this application cannot succeed.     \n                November 1, 2011                                                         _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Wayne MacKinnon\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n ", "2011canlii82100": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-18641-11\n   \nOCH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SB (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on November 1, 2011.

The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  The Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlords gave a notice of termination in bad faith and for an order determining that the Landlords harassed, obstructed, coerced, threatened or interfered with them.\n  These applications were heard in Ottawa on November 2, 2011.  The Landlords, represented by DL, and the Tenant SH, attended the hearing.  Witness for the Tenant TO, also attended and testified.\n  Findings of Fact:\n  The Tenant\u2019s witness to the signature of the Landlord GZ did not see her sign the document and did not see her at the rental unit at the time the Tenant claims the parties agreed to the new lease.\n  The signatures on the new lease are dated February 11, 2011, more than 8 \u00bd months before the end of the existing lease.\n  The existing lease was to expire on October 31, 2011 and the new lease was to commence October 1, 2011, one month before the existing lease would end.\n  The new lease includes a last month rent deposit which had previously been collected.\n  The new lease has type written initials for the Landlord GZ and the Tenant SH while the other two leases the Landlord introduced as evidence, one between the Landlords and the Tenants and another from separate unit, have personal initials.\n  The existing lease named the Landlord JZ while the new lease names both JZ and GZ as landlords.\n  The signature on the new does not appear to match the signature of GZ on the sign in sheet for the hearing.\n  The rent the Tenant claims the Landlord\u2019s accepted for October 2011 rent was deposited at a branch the Landlords testified is not one of the two branches they do business.\n  Analysis and Conclusion:\n  The Tenant claims that the Landlord GZ approached him in early February 2011 asking him to renew the existing lease which was to end on October 31, 2011, nearly 9 months later, for a 54 month term.  GZ denies that she ever spoke to the Tenant about a new lease and testified that she does not deal with this aspect of the business and has never met the Tenant.  GZ testified that her husband deals with tenants and signs the leases and that she deals with the finances of the business.  The Landlords introduced the lease they have with another tenant and testified that they no longer use the type of lease that the Tenant claims they both signed in February 2011.  The lease introduced as evidence is totally different from the lease in question.  The new lease is the same design as the Ontario Real Estate Association \u2018Form 400\u2019 used for the original lease signed between the parties.\n  GZ testified that she has never met the Tenant SH.  SH claims that she met him once during the three year tenancy when there was a flood in the unit and that she must know who he is because he cuts the grass and she can see him from their business.  Testimony shows that the Landlord JZ and their son attended to the flood and that their son was at the rental unit several times during that period of time to repair the problems from the flood.  The Landlords and their son deny that GZ was at the rental unit at the time of the flood.  I find it peculiar that SH would claim that GZ approached him about a new long term lease when there was at most one interaction between them during the tenancy and that was when the Landlord JZ and their son were at the unit to investigate a flood.  It was JZ who signed the original lease and dealt with problems such as the flood.  Even if I accepted the testimony from SH that GZ came to the unit after the flood, to accept that GZ approached SH to extend the lease for 54 months more than 8 \u00bd months before the end of the lease is inconsistent with the landlord/ tenant relationship established between the parties.\n  I also find the inconsistencies in the new lease to be suspect.  The Landlord\u2019s have several rental properties, both residential and commercial, and have been in the business for several years.   When questioned about the length of the new lease, there was no testimony or evidence presented that would lead me to believe there was an understanding between the parties that the lease would be extended for 4 \u00bd years.  I also find it peculiar that the Landlords would present a lease that would begin a full month before the old lease ends, be signed by only one of the Landlords when both are named on the front page, that the initials on the pages are type written when the other leases introduced as evidence are initialled by the parties to the leases, that the last month rent deposit would be required on the new lease when the Landlords are holding a last month rent deposit, and the signature of GZ does not appear to match her signature on the sign-in sheet for the hearing.\n  I find it unusual that the Tenant\u2019s witness, an OPP officer, would sign the lease as witness to the Landlord (GZ) and the Tenant SH signing the lease, when in fact he didn\u2019t get up from the couch to see the document being signed by GZ and didn\u2019t see her at the rental unit on February 11, 2011.  Considering the fact that GZ denies signing the lease and the witness did not actually witnesses GZ sign the document, I cannot conclude that GZ signed the lease.\n  Although the Landlords did not bring evidence to support their testimony that they do not do business at the Westgate Shopping Centre Royal Bank of Canada, where the rent cheque fro October 2011 was deposited to their account, but instead do business at two other branches, this testimony was not challenged by SH at the hearing.  It seems peculiar that the October 2011 rent would be deposited at a branch were the Landlords do not do business and that they would deposit a rent cheque for a period covered by the last month rent deposit due to the October 31, 2011 termination date on the N12 notice they served on the Tenants.\n  Considering all of the inconsistencies and highly unusual circumstances surrounding the signing of the lease, the term of the new lease, and the unusual length of time before the end of the existing lease, I conclude that the Landlords did not enter into a new tenancy agreement with the Tenants and that the end of the term on the lease between the parties was October 31, 2011.\n        November 7, 2011                                                         _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Greg Joy\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n   ", "2011canlii82259": "Order under Section 87(1)\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-18877-11\n       \nQLPM (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict NN, DR and SC (the 'Tenants') because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on October 27, 2011.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, JD, and the Tenants, attended the hearing.\n    Determinations:\n  1.

The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on November 15, 2011.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, LC, the Tenant and the Tenant\u2019s representative, RM attended the hearing.\n  The Tenant and the Community Worker testified on behalf of the Tenant.  The Landlord had four witnesses testify on their behalf.\n  The Tenant provided the Board with a Board Decision TSL-12789-11 issued on February 16, 2011 and an excerpt Toronto community Housing Corp. V. Clarke (2006), 2006 Carswell Ont 2139, [2006] O.J. No. 2711.\n  The Landlord provided the Board with an Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Divisional Court decision Robert Connelly v. Mary Lambert Swale Non-Profit Homes.(2006) Court file no: 7/06; British Columbia Provincial Court , Criminal Division, R. v. Felix [1994] B.C.J. No.1580; Supreme Court of Canada; R. v. Clemente [1994] 2.S.C.R. 758, File No: 23931.\n  The incidents of September 27, 2011 to October 3, 2011.\n  The Landlord\u2019s property manager and a maintenance staff were having a meeting when the Tenant walked by and started to yell at them and then proceeded to follow the Landlord\u2019s property manager and impeded on her personal space while using profanities at this time. When the Tenant was politely asked to step away, the Tenant again walked into the Tenant\u2019s face.  The Tenant had difficulty hearing the content of the Tenant\u2019s threats because she was so frighten by the Tenant\u2019s physical imposition.\n  A few minutes after the first incident, the Tenant called the Landlord\u2019s call center.  The call was recorded and presented at the hearing. The Tenant admits that she threaten to kill the property manager. \n  Sometime after the incident, the Tenant had a meeting with the Tenant Community Worker and told him that she could have the property manager kidnapped and raped.\n  The first incident occurred on a Tuesday, the property manager opted to take the rest of the week off and returned to work on Monday October 3, 2011.  Upon her return to work she discover in her mail box five separate voice messages from the Tenant that were recorded and presented at the hearing.  The first message says \u201c How would you like to be raped?\u201d.  The second message says \u201cPay back is a bitch\u201d. The Third message says \u201cFucking cunt\u201d. The fourth message is unclear and the fifth message is an apology.\n  Did the Tenant commit an illegal Act?\n  According to the Supreme Court Decision R. v. Clemente provided by the Landlord states\n  \u201c The intent required under s. 264.1(1)(a), which is aimed at preventing \u201cthreats, can be framed in either of the two ways put forward.  Firstly, a serious threat to kill or cause serious bodily harm must have been uttered with the intent to intimidate or instill fear.  Conversely, such a threat uttered with intent to intimidate or cause fear must have been uttered with the intent that it be taken seriously.\u201d\n  The Tenant does not dispute that she uttered the words.  The words spoken by the Tenant and the description of the incident on September 27, 2011 and the continuation of the threat to kill or cause bodily harm to the property manager in other voice messages, clearly disturbed and intimidated the property manager.  There is no doubt that the Tenant spoke the words threatening the property manager of death and bodily harm.  This is the act of the offence. The Tenant\u2019s delivery of the threats such as impeding in the property manager\u2019s space, the intensity, the repeated phone calls are all facts clearly indicating that the Tenant formulating the seriousness of intention to intimidate or instill fear in the property manager and the other people who heard the Tenants words.\n  The Tenant\u2019s representatives submits that since the Tenant does not have the capacity to execute these threats \u201d words are merely words\u201d. In the case TSL-12789-11, the Tenant has been living for 9 years in a supportive housing for persons with mental health issues.  The Tenant made a threat to another tenant.  The other tenant was not present at the hearing and the Landlord only had a letter from the other tenant while the Tenant denied ever saying these words.  Therefore, the Board member states \u201c I was not satisfied that the Tenant\u2019s behaviour seriously impaired or has seriously impaired the safety as required by Act.\u201d\n  In our case, the evidence demonstrates that the Tenant acted with intention and therefore committed an illegal contrary to section 264.1(1)a of the Code.  Whether the Tenant has the capacity to carry out the threat is irrelevant to the determination that the Tenant committed an illegal act. However, I will explore this argument in my reasons on whether I should grant the Tenant relief from eviction.\n  The Tenant is not disputing that she uttered these threats. \n  The Tenant is seeking relief from eviction.\n  Based on Letter dated October 18, 2011, the doctor LM, states that \u201cour office highly suspects that she suffers form Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as well as chronic addictions.\u201d Therefore, I am of the opinion that the Tenant is disabled within the meaning of section 17(2) of the Human Rights Code ( the \u2019Code\u2019) which states:\n  \u201cNo Tribunal or court shall find a person incapable unless it is satisfied that the needs of the person cannot be accommodated without undue hardship on the person responsible for accommodating those needs, considering, the cost, outside sources of funding, if any, and health and safety requirements, if any.\u201d\n  At the hearing, the Tenant was unable to propose an accommodation plan that the Landlord could implement to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of incident.\n  Was the incident between September 27, 2011 and October 3, 2011 an isolated incident?\nWhat are the chances of a reoccurrence?\n  At the hearing another tenant testified that on or about October 15, 2011, while she was gardening outside, the Tenant came over and threaten to \u201cbeat me in the face\u201d.\n  According to a written report from the Landlord, On October 30, 2011 at 02:07 AM, another tenant is reporting that he is having difficulties with the Tenant \u201c she is coming to his door and threatening him to have him beat up, etc.).\n  I have no reason not to believe that these two other incidences occurred.  The September 27, 2011 to October 3, 2011 incident is not an isolated incident.\n  The Tenant\u2019s representative submits that the Tenant does not have the capacity to execute the threats. I have no evidence to determine whether she will carry out or have someone carry out the threat. This application is concerning the Tenant committing an illegal act. If she carries out the threats it becomes another illegal act.\n  The fact that the Tenant has a disability does not mean that we need to relax the standards of conduct for that individual.  For example, someone who is physically disabled and is confined to a wheel chair and while waiving a large knife utters that he will kill the next person that passes in the hallway.  Because of his physical disability do we automatically conclude that he cannot execute the threats and that we should relax the standard of behaviour for an illegal act.\n  In this case, I do not have sufficient evidence that the Tenant\u2019s TPDS and additions are the cause to her committing illegal acts.  I do not have sufficient evidence that the Tenant cannot carry out the threats.  I have insufficient legal reference that the standard of behaviour for an illegal act should be relaxed in similar situation.\n  For all these reasons and circumstances, I find that the tenant should not be given relief from the eviction with the exception of granting her approximately fifteen days to find a new place to live.\n      November 29, 2011                                                        _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Gerald Naud\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n    In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on June 16, 2012 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.", "2011canlii82247": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-19642-11\n \nVP and TB (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict TC and DH (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.

On November 15, 2011, the Tenant filed a motion to set aside order EAL-18484-11.\n  This motion was heard in Ottawa on November 30, 2011.\n  The Landlord\u2019s legal representative, EMG and the Tenant attended the hearing. Duty Counsel assisted the Tenant.\n    Reasons for amendments\n  The Landlord\u2019s initial request to amend order EAL-18484-11, issued on September 23, 2011 was because the order contained a termination date that was 17 days before the date of the Landlord\u2019s application. This was a Board mistake that the Member failed to notice before signing the order. The Member issued an amended order on October 25, 2011.\n  On November 4, 2011, the Landlord filed a second request to amend the order. This time, it was because the Landlord specified an incorrect address for the Tenant in his application. The Member made a further amendment to his amended order, but did not change the amended date. Board records show that this second amended order was mailed to the parties on November 7, 2011.\n    Consequences of the Landlord\u2019s failure to provide the Board with the Tenant\u2019s correct address\n  The Tenant did not receive any of the Board\u2019s orders. She became aware of the proceedings only after receiving an eviction notice from the Sheriff. On November 10, 2011, the Landlord went to the Sheriff\u2019s office to enforce the order issued on November 7, 2011, which had the correct address for the rental unit.\n  The Landlord\u2019s error prevented the Tenant from exercising her rights to file a motion to set aside order EAL-18484-11, issued on September 23, 2011, as well as the amended order issued on October 25, 2011. She exercised her rights as soon as she was aware of the existence of an ex-parte eviction order.\n  The Landlord is requesting that the Tenant compensate it for the non-refundable fee paid to enforce the eviction order. I find on the balance of probabilities that had the Landlord used the correct address on the application for termination of the tenancy, the Tenant would have filed a motion to set aside the order upon receiving it. Therefore, the Tenant should not be liable for the errors of the Landlord.\n    The Tenant\u2019s breaches\n  The Tenant paid the rent on time from December 1, 2010 to August 1, 2011. In September 2011, the Tenant was late by 7 days and did not try to hide this. She had been incapacitated by an illness and gave a cheque to the Landlord on September 7, 2011, two weeks before the Landlord filed the application.\n  The Tenant gave to the Landlord a cheque dated October 2, 2011. Although this is a breach, this is an inconsequential one. October 1st was on a Saturday and the next business day was October 3rd.\n  The Tenant paid the November rent on time. November 2011 was the final month in order EAL-10855-11 issued on November 26, 2010.\n  I will order the Tenant to pay the rent on time for a six-month period to reinforce the responsibility of the Tenant to ensure the Landlord receive rent payments when due.\n    December 2, 2011                                                           _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     R\u00e9gent Gagnon\n                                                                                                                           Vice-Chair, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9", "2011canlii91030": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-19418-11\n   \nGD and KD (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict PB (the 'Tenant') because the Landlord requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.\n  This application was heard in Cornwall on December 1, 2011.\n  The Landlords and the Tenant attended the hearing.\n  In accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, I canvassed the Landlords and the Tenant whether there are any circumstances in this case that would cause me to consider granting relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.\n  The Tenant explained that she has a disability that makes it difficult for her to execute daily tasks and that she would need until March 31, 2011 to find a new place to live that has everything she needs including a washer and dryer all on the same floor of the unit.\n  The Landlords were willing to delay the eviction until January 31, 2011.\n  Determinations:\n  1.

I find that the Tenant has not met the following condition specified in the settlement: The Tenant held a garage sale in the common area of the residential complex on November 1 and November 2, 2011 contrary to what she had agreed to in the settlement mediated by the Board.\n3.        The Tenant pled guilty and was given a $140.00 fine for contravening Zoning-By-Law NO.2002-189 which prohibits individuals from having engaged in the sale of second hand goods more than two times in the same calendar year.\n4.

The Tenant is now aware that the Landlord has a policy prohibiting tenants from engaging in the sale of second hand goods on the premises of the residential complex as part of the Landlord\u2019s strategy to combat the problem of pest infestation in the residential complex.\n7.        The Tenant is now aware that the Landlord has been warned by the Municipality that the Landlord may be charged and fined if it permits tenants to engage in the sale of second hand goods on the premises of the residential complex.  Such activity by any tenant in the future would then interfere with the Landlord\u2019s rights, privileges and interests.\n8.        By engaging in the sale of second hand goods, The Tenant has substantially interfered with the Landlord\u2019s rights, privileges and interests.\n9.        The Tenant has agreed not to engage in the sale of any second hand goods on the premises of the residential complex for the duration of the tenancy.\n10.

The Landlord\u2019s representative, LZ, and the Tenant, assisted by Duty Counsel, attended the hearing.  Also in attendance was DG, witness for the Landlord.\n  Preliminary Matters:\n  The Tenant requested an adjournment at the beginning of the hearing.  Considering the fact that this application was adjourned on four previous occasions; that the most recent adjournment was at the Tenant\u2019s request to provide her time to file an application with the Board; that the interim order shows that the Tenant must file the application on or before November 28, 2011 and the application was not filed; that it was peremptory on the Tenant to be present and read to proceed; that the Tenant was to disclose all documents, photos and any other evidence she intended to rely on five days before the hearing to the Board and the Landlord and nothing had been disclosed; that the Landlord was not in agreement with the Tenant\u2019s request to adjourn at the last hearing; and the fact the Tenant fired her legal aid lawyer just prior to the hearing; the request to adjourn was denied as I find this to be an abuse of process.\n  The Tenant began her submissions wanting to raise issues under section 82 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  Duty Counsel was asked to meet with the Tenant while the matter was stood down so that the Tenant was aware of the problems with proceeding without sufficient evidence and the principle of res judicata.  After Duty Counsel met with the Tenant for approximately 30 minutes I was informed the Tenant wanted to address her issues and Duty Counsel assisted.\n        Issues Raised Under Section 82:\n  Water infiltration (flood) in late 2010; deteriorated drywall in the unit due to moisture; electrical safety; water dripping from light fixtures and light fixtures not functioning; a broken heater; disposal of a mattress and couch.\n  Determinations:\n  1.        Based on the fact the only evidence the Tenant had was a report about water infiltration in March 2009 and the Landlord denies there have been any water infiltration problems since that time, I find the Tenant has not supported her allegation of a flood in late 2010.\n2.        The Tenant testified the drywall in the rental unit is severely damaged due to the flood.  The Landlord\u2019s witness (DG), who has 40 years experience in fire and flood inspections and has recently inspected the Tenant\u2019s rental unit, testified that he could find no evidence of water damage in the drywall anywhere in the unit.  This inspection took place after the Tenant had initially refused entry to the Landlord and the witness.  (DG) testified there is a missing soap dish in the bathroom but that the Tenant has refused entry to allow it to be replaced.  (DG) also testified that the reason the light fixture was not working is because the light bulb was burned out.  Despite the fact the Tenant is responsible to replace light bulbs, the Landlord provided the replacement bulb and the problem was remedied.  I find the Tenant has not support her allegation the drywall is in poor condition due to a flood and that there is a problem with the light fixture.\n3.        The Tenant claims there is a problem with the electrical system in the rental unit.  The Landlord introduced a report from the Electrical Safety Authority date December 12, 2011 indicating that no defects were identified.  I find the Tenant has not supported her allegation there is a problem with the electrical system in the rental unit.\n4.        The Tenant testified that the flood in late 2010 caused her mattress and couch to become so wet she had to place them outside.  The Tenant testified she moved the items outside in May 2011.  On August 26, 2011 after the items had remained behind the garbage containers for more than 3 months, the Landlord had them removed.  I do not accept the Tenant\u2019s testimony that the Landlord is responsible for throwing away these items.  The Tenant placed them outside approximately 6 months after she claims there was a flood and left them there for another 3 months.  I find the Tenant abandoned this property and the Landlord rightfully disposed of them.\n5.        The Tenant also claims the Landlord did not respond to a problem with a heater.  The heater was replaced and the Tenant did not prove the Landlord did not respond in a timely manner.\n6.        The Tenant has not paid the total rent she was required to pay for the period from April 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective July 27, 2011.\n7.        The Tenant paid $903.00 after the application was filed.\n8.        Duty Counsel requested relief from termination of the tenancy by allowing the Tenant to pay an extra $100.00 per month to pay off the balance owing to the Landlord.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would not be unfair to postpone the eviction until January 31, 2012 pursuant to subsection 83(1)(b) of the Act.  This postponement is to allow the Tenant sufficient time to seek assistance to void this order.\n    It is ordered that:\n  1.        Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated.  The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 31, 2012.\n2.        The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $1,100.69*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to December 19, 2011.\n3.        The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $9.90 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 20, 2011 to the date she moves out of the unit.\n4.        The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n5.        If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before December 30, 2011, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from December 31, 2011 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n6.        If the unit is not vacated on or before January 31, 2012, then starting February 1, 2012, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n7.        Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after February 1, 2012.\n8.

The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $30.87 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting December 24, 2011 to the date she moves out of the unit.\n4.        The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $170.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n5.        If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 3, 2012, the Tenant will start to owe interest.  This will be simple interest calculated from January 4, 2012 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n6.        If the unit is not vacated on or before January 3, 2012, then starting January 4, 2012, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n7.        Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 4, 2012.\n8.

Loretta Moreau (W1) and Linda Boucher (W2) testified for the Landlord.\n  Witnesses were excluded at the start of the hearing.\n    Good faith\n  Does the Landlord require possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation in good faith?\n  W1 is the person who wants to move into the rental unit. She is the Landlord\u2019s mother-in-law. She is 80 years old, has difficulty with stairs, and has heart and circulatory diseases and other medical conditions associated with her age.\n  W1 currently lives in a somewhat winterized cottage in need of major work. Although not distant from the rental unit, it is somewhat isolated in the winter due to the layout of the roads and their condition that sometimes renders the cottage inaccessible by car or truck.\n  W1 wants a rental unit that has no stairs, is close to the hospital and her physicians\u2019 office and where she can get help readily from family members or friends.\nThe Tenant\u2019s representative submitted that W1 could move to another rental unit owned by members of her family and that she has no intention of selling the cottage, where she would likely return in the summer. Therefore, she only wants to move in temporarily to accommodate the Landlord who wants to evict the Tenant on any ground that he can find.\n  I find that whether or not W1 wants to keep the cottage is not an indication that she does not want to move into the rental unit. A person can have a residence and own a cottage for seasonal or intermittent use.\n  I find that W1 has a genuine intent to move into the rental unit and that the Landlord made this application in good faith.\n    Relations between the parties\n  The Landlord tried to evict the Tenant at a hearing held on April 15, 2011 at which the Tenant\u2019s application about maintenance was heard. The Landlord alleged that the Tenant wilfully or negligently caused a pipe in the heating system to freeze and break, causing damage to the rental unit of about $20,000.00. The Landlord\u2019s application was dismissed.\n  At that hearing, the Landlord said he needed to have the Tenant complete some documents for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to determine if he is eligible to rent a unit in the residential complex where the rent is subsidized. The Landlord was under the impression that he could evict the Tenant if the Tenant did not comply. On January 6, 2012, the Landlord said that CMHC had accepted the Landlord\u2019s mistake not to have the documents completed before the Tenant moving in and eviction on those grounds is no longer an issue.\n  The Landlord appears to be still convinced that the flood that occurred in the rental unit was caused by the Tenant although he did not challenge the Board decision issued on May 13, 2011. He may want the Tenant to be evicted, but he must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the application has merits sufficient to evict the Tenant.\n    Relief from eviction\n  The Tenant\u2019s representative submitted that eviction should be denied under subsection 83(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (Act) because the Landlord\u2019s application is retaliatory and the Landlord is in breach of maintenance obligations. A decision from the Divisional Court, about which the Court of Appeal refused to grant leave, is useful in this situation. In MacNeil v. 976445 Ontario Ltd, Divisional Court held that when a maintenance issue has been resolved and is no longer an issue at the hearing, clause 83(3)(a) of the Act does not apply. Similarly, Divisional Court held that the sole or primary reason for eviction must be retaliatory for subsection 83(3) to apply.\n  The Tenant\u2019s representative submitted into evidence photographs that show that repairs to walls were not completed after repairs to the damaged heating system. While necessary, these do not represent a serious breach of the Landlord\u2019s maintenance obligations. Both parties said that the heating system was working properly at the time of the hearing. The Landlord may have been in a serious breach of his obligations when the heating system was allegedly not working, but there was no breach on January 6, 2012.\n  I have to consider the impact of eviction on the Tenant and on the Landlord. While neither party is directly affected, the Tenant\u2019s wife has restricted mobility and needs a rental unit that has doors sufficiently wide for a wheelchair. Much has been said about the low availability of such units in Pembroke and area.\nThe Landlord\u2019s mother in law does not need a unit with doors wide enough for a wheelchair, but she cannot continue to live safely at the cottage. A unit in this residential complex would suit her medical needs.\n  The Tenant\u2019s wife will suffer some hardship if the Tenant cannot find a unit that meets her needs and the Landlord\u2019s mother in law is currently suffering some hardship from living at the cottage. However, I will postpone the termination of the tenancy to February 29, 2012.\n      January 24, 2012                                                            _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     R\u00e9gent Gagnon\n                                                                                                                           Vice-Chair, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n ", "2012canlii21964": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-20804-12\n       \nOPLFTRO (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BK (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard in Kingston on January 24, 2012.

The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from December 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012.  Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective January 28, 2012.\n2.        The Tenants are in possession of the rental unit.\n3.        The monthly rent is $900.00\n4.         The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $900.00 from the Tenants and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.\n5.        Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenants for the period from November 1, 2010 to January 28, 2012.\n6.        The Tenants paid $1,800.00 after the application was filed.\n7.

The noise and vibration from repair work on the foundation of the rental complex prevented the Tenants from hearing their television set and the Tenants were without a second exit from their residence during the work period. Therefore, I find that the Landlord or the Landlord's agent substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.\n9.        It would be reasonable to award the Tenants a rent rebate of $135.00 for the period from December 1, 2012 to December 23, 2012 (approximately 20% rent rebate).\n10.

Unless the Tenants void the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants is terminated.

The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $938.73*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to April 2, 2012, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.\n3.        The Tenants shall also pay to the Landlord $29.59 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting April 3, 2012 to the date they move out of the unit.\n4.

If, on or before April 13, 2012, the Tenants pay the amount of $2,870.00** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void.

The work went on for eleven weeks through Christmas and New Years and is still not finished.  The Tenant (DJ) is off during the winter because he works at a golf course and spends that time relaxing at home, and the Tenant (GK) is on ODSP and is at home as well. Both Tenants were disturbed by the constant banging to the point they could not hear the television.\n  The contractor moved some of the belongings that they had stored under the carport into the back yard and did not cover them.  As a result their belongings were damaged by the snow.  The Landlord used their electricity and blew a breaker without telling them which resulted in the food in their freezer having been spoiled.  The contractor used their electricity throughout the whole period which resulted in a much higher electric bill.  Due to the work being done on the foundation, the Tenants were without a parking space for a period of 8 weeks and had to park on the street.  The Tenants were also without a second exit because the back door was blocked for 8 weeks.\n  The Tenants were not claiming a rent abatement for November 2011 because they had already paid their rent and had only complained to the Landlord at the end of November 2011.  The Tenants paid their rent for February and March 2012 because the contractor had stopped working during that period.\n  The Tenants requested compensation for the food that they lost in the amount of $150.00, compensation for the electricity used by the contractor in the amount of $260.00, and compensation for the belongings that were damaged from having been exposed to the weather in the amount of $200.00.  The Tenants also requested a 100% rent rebate for the months of December 2011 and January 2012, as well as an ongoing rebate of $100.00 until the work is completed.\n  The Landlord\u2019s position:\n  The Landlord testimony showed the following:\n  The Landlord bought the building in February 2011.  During the spring thaw, water leaked into the basement unit and damaged the walls.  When the walls were being repaired it was noticed that there was significant damage to the foundation that needed to be repaired.  The City issued an order on June 16, 2011 to remedy an unsafe building.  The order from the City was posted on the door of the building.  The Landlord had until the end of June to obtain an Engineer\u2019s report and a building permit to repair the foundation. The Landlord discussed the issue with the Tenant (DJ) and they came to an understanding that the work would not be done in the summer so as not to interfere with the Tenants\u2019 use of the yard during the summer.  The Tenant (DJ) called the Landlord at the end of October 2011 enquiring as to when the work would take place.  The Landlord told him that the work would start on November 8, 2011.  The Tenant asked for compensation related to the work done in November 2011 and the Landlord and the Tenants agreed on a 22% rent abatement for November, 2011. \n  While the contractors were working on the foundation, they discovered that the damage was more extensive than originally thought.  The work was terminated on December 22, 2011.\n  The Landlord submitted a letter from the engineering firm dated February 23, 2012 showing that they found the repair and replacement of the damaged foundation wall to have been completed in general conformance with the approved construction drawings.\n  The Landlord submitted 3 letters from the contractor who did the work.  The first letter showed that the work began from November 8, 2011 and was completed December 22, 2011 and that all work was done within the hours permitted by the City\u2019s noise by-laws.  The contractor explains in the letter that the driveway was obstructed for a period of five weeks until December 9, 2011, but room was maintained for one vehicle at the end of the driveway.  The second letter showed that during the waterproofing process, the contractor required a power source to connect the heater.  The contractor used the closest outlet which overloaded the circuit and caused the breaker to trip. After having the breaker reset a few times the contractor gave up and drew power from inside the basement unit instead for the duration of the work.  When informed by the Tenants that the tripped breaker caused the meat in their freezer to spoil, the contractor had offered to submit a claim to his insurance company if the Tenants were to come forward with evidence to substantiate their loss so that he could provide the receipts to his insurance for reimbursement.  However the Tenants never followed up on his offer.  The third letter showed that all the tenants had been advised to clear the perimeter of the house of any items.  On the first day of work, the Tenant from the basement unit had already complied with the request.  The contractor stored the Tenants remaining items under a corrugated steel shelter opened on three ends because the Tenant (GK) who was at home at the time was unable to move the items himself.  At no point while the contractor was on sight did the Tenants express any concern for the items that were placed in the yard.\n  The Landlord submitted a letter from the Tenant in the basement unit that shows that the contractors were on sight from November 8, 2011 to December 23, 2011.\n  Analysis:\n  Issue of credibility:\n  I found the Landlord\u2019s evidence and testimony to be consistent and credible and I preferred it to that of the Tenants which I found to be inconsistent on several levels.  One example of inconsistent testimony from the Tenants was their testimony about the duration of the interference with their reasonable enjoyment. \n  The Tenants testified that they did not claim a rent abatement for November 2011 because they had already paid the rent for that month.  The Landlord\u2019s evidence was that he had provided the Tenants with a 22% rent abatement for November 2011 in relation to the work that was being done on the foundation.  In response to the Landlord\u2019s evidence, the Tenants testified that they did receive a 22% rent abatement for November 2011 but that it had been given to them as compensation for mould issues and a door that stuck on a bump in the floor. If the Tenants\u2019 complaint of interference with their reasonable enjoyment is related to the work on the foundation that started November 8, 2011 as well as the short notice they received about the work to be done, it does not make sense that they would not be claiming a rent rebate related to November 2011 when the work began.  The Tenants adduced no evidence to corroborate their story of a rent rebate and I find the Landlord\u2019s version of the 22% rent rebate for November 2011 to be more plausible on the balance of probabilities.\n  A second example of inconsistency in the Tenants\u2019 testimony is their testimony regarding a lack of notice for the work to be done.  They testified that they had only been given a couple of days notice from the Landlord that work was to begin on the foundation in November 2011 and were not given the minimum sixty day notice required by the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.  They admitted after the Landlord had provided his evidence that they were aware of the City\u2019s order to remedy an unsafe building, a notice which was posted on the door of the building in June 2011.  I therefore find that the Tenants were aware of the imminent nature of the work to be done more than sixty days before it began in November 2011.  I believe on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord did have a discussion and agreement with the Tenant (DJ) to postpone the work so as not to interfere with the Tenants\u2019 use of the yard during the summer. \n  Another example of inconsistent testimony was when the Tenants testified that the work lasted 11 weeks (which was more than the two weeks they were told it would last), that the work carried on through Christmas and New years and that it is still not complete.  As a consequence, the Tenants were requesting a 100% rent rebate for the Months of December 2011 and January 2012 as well as an ongoing monthly rebate of $100.00 until the work is terminated.  After the Landlord provided his evidence about the duration of the work, the Tenants were unable to substantiate that any work had been carried on after December 23, 2012.  I believe that the Tenants attempted to embellish their argument with reference to work being done over two important holidays when there was no evidence to corroborate that allegation.  I find that the Tenants have failed to convince me on the balance of probabilities that the work went beyond December 23, 2012.\n  Issue of compensation for lost food:\n  I believe on the balance of probabilities that the contractor offered to make a claim with his insurance company with respect to any frozen goods that may have been lost by the Tenants when the breaker was tripped by the contactor. The Tenants were never able to provide the contractor with any evidence of the alleged loss to show his insurer and the Tenants did not have any evidence to corroborate their allegation before the Board.  I therefore find that the Tenants have failed to convince me on the balance of probabilities that they sustained a loss due to the contractor having tripped a breaker related to the Tenants\u2019 unit.\n  Issue of compensation for electricity used by the contractor:\n  The Tenants testified that the contractor has been using their electricity for the duration of the work that they alleged went on for 11 weeks and used the equivalent of $260.00 worth of electricity for which the Tenants had been billed.  In contrast, the letter from the contractor showed that the contractor had used the basement tenant\u2019s electricity for the duration of the project after the breaker had to be reset in the Tenants\u2019 unit. In examining the Ottawa Hydro bill submitted into evidence by the Tenants, I find that the bill shows a charge of $345.84 for the two month period ending December 15, 2011.  The charge for the following two month period ending February 16, 2012 is for $290.83. I believe on the weight of the evidence before me that the foundation work stopped on December 23, 2011 at the latest.  There is an approximate difference of $55.00 between the Hydro bill for the period when the work was going and the two month period there was no work.  The Tenants\u2019 evidence does not substantiate that the contractor used $260.00 worth of electricity.  I am not convinced on the balance of probabilities that the contractor used a meaningful amount of the Tenants\u2019 electricity, and it is impossible for me to determine how much of the $55.00 difference can be attributed to seasonal changes.  It would therefore not be appropriate to award the Tenants any compensation with respect to their electricity bill.\n  Issue of compensation for items damaged by the contractor:\n  The Tenants failed to convince me on the balance of probabilities that they did not know their possessions had been moved to an unprotected area of the yard.  The Tenants have a duty to minimize losses pursuant to section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 and should have moved the very visible items to another location if they were worried about them being damaged by the elements, or at the very least asked the contractor to move them elsewhere.  The Tenants submitted no evidence to corroborate their allegation that items were damaged.  The Tenants submitted no evidence to support their claim of a loss of $200.00 related to the items in question.  It would therefore not be appropriate to award any compensation to the Tenants for the alleged damaged items.\n  Issue of compensation for interference with reasonable enjoyment:\n  Section 8 of the regulations O. Reg.516/06 provides for the conditions when a rent abatement is justified with respect to interference with reasonable enjoyment during repairs. \n  Since both tenants were at home during the repairs, the Tenants allege that the foundation work substantially interfered with the Tenants\u2019 reasonable enjoyment of the unit due to the constant noise and vibration that prevented them from hearing their television set. \n  It is clear from the Work Order from the City that the foundation work done by the Landlord was necessary to protect or restore the physical integrity of the residential complex or part of it. The Tenants were aware of the work order more than 60 days before the work was undertaken.  The work was carried out at reasonable times in compliance with existing noise by-laws.  The only part of the regulations which would allow for the Board to award a rent abatement to the Tenants is with respect to sect 8 (4)5. which requires the Landlord to provide the Tenant with an update in case there is any significant change in the information provided in the notice.  There is no indication that the Landlord updated the Tenants as to the additional time required to complete the work once it was discovered that the problem was worse than originally thought.  It would therefore be appropriate to award a rent abatement with respect to this issue. \n  Pursuant to section 8(6) of the regulations no abatement shall exceed 25% of the monthly rent of the months for which there was substantial interference except as permitted under section 8(7) of the regulations.  I am not satisfied that the foundation work done by the Landlord meets the criteria listed in section 8(7) of the regulations.  Therefore any rebate awarded would be limited to 25% of the monthly rent for any one month. \n  One of the elements of the repair work that allegedly interfered with the Tenants\u2019 reasonable enjoyment was the absence of a parking spot during the repair period, and the absence of a secondary exit.\n  In light of the Landlord\u2019s evidence on the availability of a parking space at the end of the driveway, I find that the Tenants failed to convince me on the balance of probabilities that they were without a parking space for any period of time.\n  However, I do find that the noise and possible vibrations from the repairs disturbed the Tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment of their unit.\n   I believe the repairs took place between November 8, 2011 and December 23, 2011.  The Tenants did not claim for compensation for November 2011. It would therefore be appropriate that the rent abatement cover only the period from December 1 to December 23, 2012.  In light of the Tenants\u2019 failure to prove that the repairs caused them to be without a parking space, it would be reasonable to award a rent abatement that is less than the maximum of 25%.  I therefore find that a 20% rent abatement would be more reasonable under the circumstances.  In consideration that the lawful monthly rent is $900.00 and the Tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment of their unit was disturbed for a period of 23 days at most (3/4 of the month), it would be appropriate to award a rent abatement of $135.00 (3 weeks or 3/4 of the monthly rent of $900.00 X 20% rent abatement).\n  April 2, 2012                                                                     _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     John Nolan\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n ", "2012canlii30030": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-22335-12\n       \nFA (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict HW (the 'Tenant') because she, another occupant of the rental unit or someone she permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant.

The Landlord\u2019s agent, Mr. Bob Pritchett and the Tenant attended the hearing.\n  Reasons:\n  1.      The Tenant is a post-graduate student at Queen\u2019s University.  The Tenant is from Iran.  He signed a lease agreement with the Landlord on or about August 12, 2011.  The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant commenced on September 1, 2011. \n  2.      The Tenant arrived from Iran to Canada on September 20, 2011.  The Tenant paid his rent for the September 2011 rent on September 26, 2011.\n  3.      On September 27, 2011, the Landlord issued a first notice to the Tenant for rent past due.  The notice of rent past due mentions that the Tenant owes the Landlord $810.00 for the September rent. \n  4.      Since the Tenant was late in paying the September 2011 rent on the first banking day of September 2012, the Landlord\u2019s September 27, 2011 provide the Tenant with a letter/notice explaining that the Landlord will file an L9 application to collect the rent the Tenant owes and that this carries a charge of $170.00 only in the event the Tenant is again late in paying the rent.  In the same letter/notice the Landlord mentions that if the Tenant is unable to pay the September rent by October 3, 2011, the Tenant is required to contact the Landlord and set up an appointment by October 5, 2011.  The Landlord provides the Tenant a type of mechanism or process in the event the Tenant is facing circumstances delaying is payment of the rent on the first banking day of the month.\n  5.      The Tenant is alleging that because of the world situation with Iran, he is having difficulty accessing the monies for his rent and that his money has been greatly devalued and that the Landlord should accommodate him.\n  6.      In February 2012, the Tenant admitted that he never advised the Landlord of his difficulties in accessing his monies.  The Landlord\u2019s September 27, 2011 letter/notice to the Tenant indicated that the if the Tenant advised the Landlord of his problem for paying his rent late, the Landlord would listen and determine if he would proceed with filing an application with the Board.\n  7.      I sympathize with the Tenant\u2019s economic situation. However, there is no doubt that the Tenant knew or ought to have known the consequences of paying his February 2012 rent late and he opted  to not advise the Landlord of his economic hardship.\n  8.      For these reasons, I find that the Tenant is responsible for the Landlord\u2019s cost of $170.00 for filing an application.\n      April 5, 2012                                                                     _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Gerald Naud\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n ", "2012canlii30024": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-22369-12\n             \nDRUS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SP (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on April 2, 2012.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, AM, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.\n  The parties agreed that the total amount of the outstanding arrears, including costs, is $2,634.08.

This application was not before the Board and therefore I have no jurisdiction to make the order.\n  At the hearing, the Landlord requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application.\n  In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Act, I consent to the withdrawal of the application.\n      April 12, 2012                                                                  _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Greg Joy\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n  If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.", "2012canlii30322": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-22554-12\n       \nOCH (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict BR and MA (the 'Tenants') because they have been persistently late in paying their rent.

The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenants to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  The Tenants applied for an order determining that the Landlord failed to meet the Landlord's maintenance obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') or failed to comply with health, safety, housing or maintenance standards.\n  These applications were heard in Pembroke on April 16, 2012.  The Landlord, represented by IK, and the Tenants, represented by RO, attended the hearing.  Also in attendance were four witnesses called by the Tenants to testify.\n  Preliminary Matters:\n  The parties agreed prior to the commencement of the hearing not to exclude the Tenants\u2019 witnesses from the hearing room.\n  Issues:\n  The Landlord claims the Tenants have damaged an interior door and what the cost is to replace the door; replace and install an exterior door and screen door; supply and install flooring in the living and dining room; supply and install a bathtub and tub surround; repair and paint walls; repair basement stair; replace a wireless doorbell; replace accessories for a central vacuum system; plumbing costs; replace a garage door.  The Landlord is seeking $11,673.82 and termination of the tenancy.\n  The Tenants claim the Landlord has not repaired the garage door; stove fan; dripping bathtub taps; basements stairs; driveway.  The Tenants are seeking $4,800.00, approximately 48% of the rent they have paid over the past 12 months.\n  Determinations:\n  The Landlord provided letters from people who were not present to testify at the hearing.  As such, I give these letters little weight and give more weight to the direct testimony from witnesses that the Landlord\u2019s representative had the opportunity to cross examine.\n  Basement Stairs: The parties agree the basement stairs have been repaired and are not pursuing this issue.\n  Interior Door: The Tenants dispute that they caused damage to the door.  The Tenants\u2019 witness Michel Lavoie (ML) testified that the door broke while he was a tenant in the unit 5 years before the Tenants moved in due to the misalignment of the door in the door jam.  He repaired it and at the time it would function.  Cross examination did not discredit this testimony.  I find the door was broken before the Tenants moved into the unit.\n  Bathtub and Surround:  The Landlord claims that the Tenants painted the bathtub and damaged the tub surround and that it now needs to be replaced.  The Tenants dispute the Landlord\u2019s claim.  (ML) testified that bathtub was painted when he lived there and a second tenant witness, Trevor Moss (TM), testified that he repaired the tub surround because it was falling apart and very old.  I accept the testimony that the bathtub was painted before the Tenants moved in and from the photographs submitted as evidence by the Tenants, it appears that the bathtub and surround are very old and have outlived their useful life.  I find the Tenants are not responsible for the bathtub or surround.\n  Exterior Door and Screen Door:  The Tenants\u2019 witness (TM) along with the three other witnesses testified that the does not fit in the opening properly and as a result it would not open or close properly.  (TL) who lived in the home, testified it was like that when he lived there.  The struggle to close the door caused damage over time.  (TM) who has worked for a window and door company for 20 years, testified that he replaced the old door for the Tenants with a new higher quality door than was there previously.  All witnesses testified the screen door was damaged and did not fit properly from the time the Tenants moved into the unit.  In addition, testimony from the Landlord and the Tenants shows that the foundation was repaired in 2009.  I find the issues related to these items had to do with the alignment of the house and that the Tenants replaced the rear door with a similar or better new door at no expense to the Landlord.  I also find the screen door was damaged before the Tenants moved into the unit and that the torn screen is the only damage that was caused after the tenancy commenced.\n  Flooring: Photographs and testimony show that the floors are very old and have been in a state of disrepair for a long time.  Notices from the Landlord to enter the unit to perform an inspection introduced as evidence show that the Landlord was in the unit on at least 7 occasions between April 2011 and February 2012.  It would seem reasonable to assume that if the floors were in such a state of disrepair due to the Tenants\u2019 wilful or negligent damage the Landlord would have taken steps to deal with this issue after the inspections or one would have to ask the purpose of the inspections in the first place.  Testimony from (ML) shows that the floors were in a state of disrepair when he lived there, linoleum tiles in the kitchen had nails in places and the substance the Landlord claims is cat litter is actually the ruminants of carpet that was removed a long time ago.  I find the Tenants did not cause wilful or negligent damage to the floors.\n  Repair and Paint Walls: When the Tenants moved into the rental unit the Landlord provided them with the tools to paint the interior of the home and 2 gallons of paint to complete the work.  The Tenants undisputed testimony shows that the amount of paint provided was not adequate to finish the work and the Landlord did not provide additional paint.  As a result there are areas of the walls that are not painted and continue to have exposed plaster from repairs.  A photograph shows there is a hole in one wall where the doorknob from a door had broken through the wall over time.  There is also one small area of a wall where there are 10 nails holes in a confined area.  I find the Tenants are responsible for the cost to repair the holes in the wall.  Considering the fact the Tenants performed the labour to paint the walls for the Landlord when they moved in 6 years ago and the Landlord, having been in the rental unit several times over the years has not been concerned about the condition of the walls while the Tenants resided in the unit, I find the request for $5,085.00 to paint and repair the walls to not only be excessive but leads me to question the credibility of the notice and application.\n  Wireless Doorbell:  The Landlord testified there was a wireless doorbell when the Tenants moved in and it is now missing.  The Tenants testified there was not a wireless doorbell.  There was no evidence that there was a wireless doorbell and one of the Tenants\u2019 witnesses testified there was no doorbell.  I find there is insufficient evidence to support this claim.\n  Central Vacuum:  The Tenants testified and introduced a photograph showing that all of the parts to the central vacuum, which they and a witness claim the vacuum does not work, are in the rental unit.  I find the Tenants have not disposed of these items.\n  Plumbing Costs: The Landlord claims that the Tenants caused problems with the plumbing by pouring grease down the drain, clogged the drain with hair and caused a small rag to block the drain.  The invoices submitted by the Landlord make no reference costs related to either grease or hair.  There is one invoice that shows a small rag was in the drain causing a leak.  I find, considering the length of time the Tenants have lived in the unit, the Tenants caused the rag to enter the drain and responsible for the $118.55 cost the Landlord incurred to have the problem repaired.\n  Garage Door:  Testimony from the Tenants\u2019 witnesses and photographs of the garage show that the garage is old and out of alignment.  The track the door runs on is detached from the wall and door does not open and close properly.  The Landlord introduced a report from Risk Management Services Inc. and argues there are no safety issues identified regarding the garage.  Although this may be true, the issue is whether the Tenants damaged the door and should pay $904.00 to replace the door as requested by the Landlord, or if the door has not been operating properly and the Landlord has not repaired it for the Tenants.  There is no evidence that the door is damaged and requires replacement.  However, there is evidence the track and operating system are in need of repair and the Landlord has done nothing to address the problem since being informed in writing on November 25, 2011.  I find the Landlord has not repaired the garage door and this has made it difficult for the Tenants to open and close the door.\n  Stove Fan:  A photograph of the outside vent shows that there is a hole in the wall above the vent and this hole needs to be repaired.  Considering the fact that the Tenants informed the Landlord in writing on November 25, 2011 that the stove fan is broken and needs to be fixed, I find the Landlord has not repaired the stove fan as required.\n  Bath Tub Taps:  The Landlord replaced the seals for the bath tub taps within the past 12 months.  The Tenants complained in writing on November 25, 2011 that they are dripping and the Landlord has not investigated the issue.\n  Driveway:  The Landlord acknowledges that the driveway is in need of repair and testified that the work will be done after the ground has thawed.  The Tenants testified that they have damaged their muffler due to the condition of the driveway but had no evidence to show they incurred an expense due to the damage.\n  I find the requests for compensation from both applications to be excessive.  I find the issues that the Landlord has demonstrated the Tenants are responsible for which are the screen for the screen door, a hole in the wall where a door opens, the nail holes in the walls and the cost of the plumber offset the issues the Tenants have demonstrated the Landlord has failed to repair including the stove fan, garage door and driveway.  As a result no money is owing to either party.  This decision takes into consideration the costs the parties paid to file the applications with the Board.\n  I find the Landlord has not established that the Tenants have wilfully or negligently damaged the rental unit.  The tenancy will not be terminated as requested.\n  It is ordered that:\n  The Landlord shall repair the driveway.\n  The Landlord shall inspect and ensure the stove fan functions properly and the outside hole is sealed.\n  The Landlord shall repair the bathroom taps as required.\n  The Landlord shall ensure the garage door functions properly.\n  The balance of the Landlord's and the Tenants\u2019 applications are dismissed.\n      April 19, 2012                                                                  _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Greg Joy\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n    Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n  If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.", "2012canlii29993": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-22864-12\n       \nGS (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict KD (the 'Tenant') because he, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on April 18, 2012.\n  The Landlord, the Tenant, and the Tenant\u2019s representative and CMHA worker, MM, attended the hearing.\n  The Landlord made several allegations against the Tenant, with respect to his behaviour in the rental complex. The Landlord spoke about three separate incidents, where police were called and involved. One of those incidents, where the Landlord claims that the Tenant was wielding a knife, may be an appropriate reason in the case of this application for impairment of safety of the Landlord or another tenant. The police were on hand, there were no charges laid (in any of the alleged offences), and the Tenant explained that someone had rapped on his door while he was cooking and eating, and he simply opened the door with a knife in his hand that he was using at the time to eat, and there was no instance of the Tenant using the knife as a weapon, or in any \u2018threatening\u2019 way toward the Landlord or any Tenant.\n  The Landlord related all of this evidence as second hand information, and had no evidence (documentary, photographic or in-person witnesses) to support any of his allegations.\n  The Tenant\u2019s worker from CMHA explained that the complaint about excessive noise in the rental unit at all hours of the day and night maybe due to medications that the Tenant is presently taking.

AC testified on behalf of the Tenant.\n    REASONS\n  The issue:\n  The issue to be decided in this application is whether the Landlord in good faith requires possession of the rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.\nThe Landlord\u2019s position:\nThe Landlord has included an affidavit from her son in the application that states that the son is having personal problems at his present address and that his mother has agreed to let him move into the unit in question until the problem is resolved.\nThe Landlord explained that her son had lost his job in the fall of 2011 and that the ensuing financial problems have caused a severe strain on his relationship with his partner and their living arrangement since the Landlord\u2019s son is unable to contribute financially.  Therefore the Landlord has offered to help out her son by offering to let him move into the Tenant\u2019s unit.\nThe Tenant\u2019s position:\nTestimony from the Tenant and his witness shows the following:\nThe Tenant does not believe that the Landlord is acting in good faith since she has been trying to get rid of him for some time.  The Tenant believes that the Landlord has been trying to get rid of him because he has been problematic to her by preventing her from doing things her way to the detriment of his rights. \nThe Tenant complained to the Landlord of a water leak on April 8, 2011 that originated in the unit above his unit and that caused damage to the ceiling above his bed as well as damage to the wall and ceiling in his bathroom and to some of his belongings.  The Landlord has still not repaired the damage to his unit.\nIn the summer 0f 2011, the Landlord was unhappy with the placement of the Tenant\u2019s barbeque beside the house and asked him to move it.  When the Tenant moved it onto the front veranda, the Landlord called the fire chief to have the Tenant remove it.  The fire chief did not oblige the Tenant to move the barbeque off the veranda.   \nOn June 24, 2011, the Landlord was ordered by the Electrical and Safety Authority to take corrective action in relation to deficiencies found during an inspection.  The Tenant believes that the Landlord suspects that he was behind the complaint to the Electrical Safety Authority, and had given him an unlawful eviction notice in retaliation.  The Landlord gave him an eviction notice on July 5, 2011 that stated \u201cDue to renovations required to bring electrical service up to code as advised by the Electrical Safety Authority, it is necessary that I give notice of sixty days to vacate the above premise where you now reside, making it accessible for the electrical contractor to come in as arranged on Tuesday, September 6, 2011\u201d.  However the Electrical Safety Authority did not require vacant possession for the work to be done, as was confirmed in an August 8, 2011 letter from the Electrical Safety Authority to the Tenant.  The Tenant wrote the Landlord a letter on September 1, 2012, telling her that he did not accept her eviction Notice.  The Landlord called the police on September 8, 2012 to attempt to remove the Tenant from the unit and move his belongings out, but he and his friend managed to convince the police that the eviction notice from the Landlord was not legal.\nIn her attempt to have the Tenant move, the Landlord refused his rent cheque for August 2011.  When the Tenant had his friend (AC) put the money directly into the Landlord\u2019s account, the Landlord phoned (AC)\u2019s employer to try and have him fired for being a trouble maker.\nOn October 17, 2012, the Landlord gave the Tenant a rent increase notice.  The rent increase was to take effect on February 1, 2012.  The Tenant refused to pay the rent increase as it was not on a form approved by the Board.  The Landlord filed her application in March 2012 for owner\u2019s own use and the Tenant believes that this is just another attempt to get rid of a troublesome tenant who won\u2019t comply with a Landlord\u2019s every whim.\nAnalysis\nThe Landlord was given the opportunity to cross examine the Tenant and his witness with respect to potentially damaging allegations that appeared to show the Landlord was willing to go to great lengths to have the Tenant evicted.  The Landlord declined her opportunity to cross examine the witnesses.  I would have expected the average reasonable individual to attempt to discredit the witnesses\u2019 testimony through cross examination if the allegations were indeed false or inaccurate.\n  The Landlord was given the opportunity to respond to the allegations.  She explained that she had not repaired the water damage from the leak that happened in April 2011 because the Tenant would not let in the repairman.  It does not make sense to me that she was able to enter the unit to comply with the Order from the Electrical Safety Authority in September 2011 but still had still not made the repairs from water damage that occurred several months earlier because she was not let into the unit. \n  She explained that she thought she needed vacant possession of the Tenant\u2019s unit to comply with the Work Order from the Electrical Safety Authority because some of the walls would need to be cut to run the wires. However, she did not have any statement from the Electrical Safety Authority requiring vacant possession to justify giving the Tenant an eviction notice for that purpose.  It appears that the Landlord had given the Tenant an eviction notice in July 2011 in retaliation for his possible involvement in the inspection from the Electrical Safety Authority and the subsequent Work Order.\n  She explained that she had called (AC)\u2019s employer because he was responsible for the money coming into her account.  Her explanation did not satisfy me as to why she would have called (AC)\u2019s employer.  In view of all the circumstances, I prefer the testimony from the Tenant and his witness that she called (AC)\u2019s employer to have (AC) fired for being a trouble maker.  It appears that the Landlord was trying to solidify her attempt to evict the Tenant whose rent would not have been accepted if it had not been for the intervention of (AC) and his direct deposit into the Landlord\u2019s account.\n  The Landlord stated that she disagreed with most of the other allegations which she brushed over by saying that all of theses issues were in the past and that what mattered most was that her son needed to move into the rental unit because of the situation with his finances and relationship with his girl friend with whom he was living.\n  I believe on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord has found the Tenant to be a thorn in her side with respect to such issues of the placement of the Barbeque, unattended maintenance issues related to the water leak, the Work Order from the Electrical Safety Authority, and the Tenant\u2019s refusal of a rent increase.  I believe on the balance of probabilities that to Landlord\u2019s failure to evict the Tenant with an illegal notice and police intervention in September 2011, has led her to attempt to evict the Tenant with the only remaining option available to her under the Act.  The timing of her application in March of 2012 on the heels of a rent increase that was to take effect in February 2012 and refused by the Tenant, along with the Landlord\u2019s pattern of behaviour since April 2011 leads me to believe on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord has been trying to get rid of a tenant she sees as troublesome.  I therefore believe on the balance of probabilities that the Landlord does not in good faith require the Tenant\u2019s rental unit for the purpose of residential occupation.\n    April 20, 2012                                                                  _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     John Nolan\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n ", "2012canlii29978": "Notice under Section 74(5) Acknowledging Order Void\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-21923-12-VO\n     \nSLSA (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict JCl (the 'Tenant') because he did not pay the rent that he owes.\n  On March 15, 2012 the Board issued order EAL-21923-12 terminating the tenancy and evicting\nthe Tenant.\n  On April 3, 2012, the Tenant filed a motion to void an eviction order for arrears of rent.\n  This motion was heard on April 11, 2012 in Ottawa.

The Landlord has also applied for an order requiring the Tenant to compensate the Landlord for the damage. The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenant remained in the unit after the termination date.

I find that the Tenant tampered and continues to tamper with the electricity in her rental unit.  The Tenant shuts-off the smoke detectors and this seriously impairs the safety of the other residents in the five other rental units.\n2.

The injury to the Tenant has imposed additional expenses and deprived the Tenant of additional sources of income which has resulted in financial difficulties and the accumulation of arrears of rent.  The people responsible for the accident have accepted liability and compensation is expected.  However, the value of the claim cannot be determined until the Tenant has achieved maximum medical recovery which is impossible to predict.  Claims of this nature usually take one year to eighteen months to resolve.  The Tenant intends to pay his monthly rent on time and would pay the arrears as soon as the settlement arrives, or in the alternative would pay $50.00 per month towards the arrears and costs from April 1, 2013 to September 1, 2013, and $100.00 per month from October 1, 2013 to March of 2014.

The Landlord served a notice of termination on the Tenants.  The Tenants vacated the rental unit on June 2, 2012.\n  2.      The lawful rent when the Tenants moved into the rental unit was $1,100.00.  The Landlord never served a notice of rent increase as required by the Residential Tenancies Act.  Despite the fact the Landlord wrote into the lease that the rent would increase by $25.00 per month after one year, a landlord must serve a valid notice for the increase to be lawful.  I find the Tenants paid a $25.00 per month unlawful rent increase for 9 months.  The Landlord owes the Tenants $225.00.\n  3.      The Residential Tenancy Agreement which was authored by the Landlord at paragraph 8 states \u201cthe Landlord acknowledges receipt from the Tenant of the sum of $1,100.00 as prepayment of the last month\u2019s rent\u201d.  The Landlord claims he did not receive a last month rent deposit.  The Tenants testified they paid a last month rent deposit.  Considering the fact that the Landlord allowed the Tenants to move into the unit with an acknowledgement of the payment of a last month rent deposit in the agreement, I find on the balance of probabilities that the Tenants paid an $1,100.00 last month rent deposit.\n  4.      The Landlord has not paid the Tenants interest owing on the last month rent deposit.  Interest has been calculated at $32.36.  The Landlord owes the Tenants $32.36.\n  5.      The Tenants claim they gave the Landlord a $580.00 personal cheque.  The Landlord testified he returned the cheque to the Tenants, testimony the Tenants dispute.  This order will not include a credit for the $580.00 payment and the Landlord is not to cash this cheque if it is in his possession.\n  6.      The Tenants agree they owe the Landlord one month rent for the month of April.  I find the lawful rent for April was $1,100.00.\n  7.      The Tenants argue they have been paying for the electricity for air conditioning that they did not control.  They also claim they have been paying for electricity for the laundry room.  I find the Tenants received the services of the air conditioning and the Tenants failed to prove that they have been paying for electricity in the basement.\n  8.      The Tenants did not vacate the rental unit until June 2, 2012.  They testified they paid the Landlord for the extra 2 days.  This was included in the $580.00 cheque they gave the Landlord.  Considering the fact the Landlord will be ordered not to cash the cheque, I find the Tenants also owe the Landlord $72.33 for the 2 days in June.\n  9.      Considering the fact that the Tenants were in arrears at the time the application was filed with the Board, I find the Tenants are responsible for the $170.00 cost of the application.\n  10.   I find the Tenants owe the Landlord $1,084.97.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.      The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,084.97 on or before June 20, 2012.\n2.

The Landlords also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on July 3, 2012.  The Landlords and the Tenants attended the hearing.  The Tenants were represented by MG.\n  Determinations:\n  1.     The tenants from the upper unit of the triplex were concerned when the smoke alarms went off in the rental complex on the evening of June 15, 2012.  They were particularly concerned by the Tenant DH\u2019s questionable state of sobriety when smoke was emanating from his unit and filling the hallway as well as the Tenant\u2019s apparent lack of concern following the incident. \n2.     The Tenant DH had left food cooking unattended on the stove in the basement unit which caused smoke to set off the smoke detectors in the three unit triplex.  A neighbour\u2019s wife had knocked on the Tenant\u2019s door to check on the smoke.  The Tenant removed the pan from the stove and let the smoke clear out from his opened front door and through the open door to the complex.  There was no evidence of a fire or fire damage and the smoke detector in the Tenants\u2019 unit was found to be functional after the incident.  The neighbouring tenants did not feel enough concern to evacuate their unit or to call the fire department.\n3.     In considering that smoke alarms are designed to alert people to attend to a problem before it gets out of hand, such as in situations like this where a pan has been inadvertently left on a heating element, and in considering that the smoke alarm in the Tenant\u2019s unit was functional and not disabled, and that the Tenant DH was the one who attended to the source of the smoke himself when he became aware of the problem, and in considering and that there was no fire or damage, and the neighbouring tenants were not concerned enough to call the fire department or evacuate their unit, I find that the Landlord has failed to convince me on the balance of probabilities that the Tenants seriously impaired the safety of any person, or that they have used the rental unit or the residential complex in a manner that is inconsistent with use as a residential premises and that has caused or can be expected to cause significant damage to the premises.\nIt is ordered that:\n  1.

The Tenant was assisted by Duty Counsel, DW.\n  In accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, I canvassed the Landlord and the Tenant as to whether there are any circumstances in this case that would cause me to consider granting relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.

The Tenant required legal representation at the hearing.\u201d\n  b)   At the hearing on June 14, 2012, the Landlord claimed that he did not receive the Tenants money order dated May 2, 2012.  At the hearing, the Landlord agreed that he received the Tenants money order dated May 2, 2012 and offset the amount against the April 2012.  The Tenant (LT) claims that she was unable to understand that she was being evicted for rent owing for months the Tenants had already paid.  She believed that the Board and the Landlord were trying to pull something over her.\n  c)   \u201cThe Tenant was unable to understand why the Board, on her Landlord\u2019s request, would have her pay $18.00 to trace her May money order.\u201d\n  A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  1.

The Tenants did not raise the issue that they needed to be represented.

I find the fact that the Tenants paid $18.00 to determine if the Landlord had cashed the May 2, 2012 money order, and that the Landlord in the second hearing agreed that he had cashed the May 2, 2012 money order do not constitute a serious error of fact or a serious error of law.\n7.

At the time of signing the lease agreement, the Landlord\u2019s representative brought to the attention of the Tenant, an addendum to the lease agreement, which was, in fact, notice of a prompt payment promotion. This was a promotion that the Tenant wanted to be a part of.\n  The promotion was a separate contract added to the main lease agreement. This contract between the Landlord and the Tenant, promised to credit the Tenant $850.00 for his rental unit (1023) at 201 Bell Street, in Ottawa, ON. The credit was to be applied to the rent of May, 2012, as well as a further credit of $300.00 off for the first month\u2019s rent (July 1, 2011).\n  The Tenant, in this case, wanting to be sure that he had all the ingredients for the promotion, specifically asked the office staff if he had followed all of the rules, and paid all of the rental amounts to qualify for the promotion. The staff person checked over all of the Tenant\u2019s information and the Tenant provided her with post dated cheques for each month, except the month of May, 2012 (because that was to be the free month), and the staff person assured him that everything was in place for him to benefit from the promotion.\n  The Landlord cashed all of the Tenant\u2019s post dated cheques, as the cheques became due and payable during each month of the tenancy, and, in May, 2012, there was no cheque to cash because the Tenant believed, based both on the assurance of the staff person in the office, and the promotion contract itself, that there was no cheque necessary to cover the month of May, 2012. Nowhere on the promotion contract  is the amount of $905.00 even mentioned. The contract deals throughout, with one amount of rent ($850.00). Only in the more formal lease agreement, do we see the additional amount of $55 for the parking. This is something that should have been brought to the Tenant\u2019s attention by both the Landlord\u2019s representative, and the staff person that assured the Tenant that he was all paid up for the promotion. On May 4, 2012 (a time when the Tenant was supposed to be rent-free for the remainder of the lease agreement) when the Landlord\u2019s representative brought this to the attention of the Tenant (i.e. the payment of the $55.00 for parking), he immediately paid that parking charge.\n  Because of the way that this contract is phrased, and lacking any mention of the parking fee, just the rental portion of $850.00 in the contract, and then having the Tenant told, by staff in the office, that he qualifies with the post dated cheques that he provided to the Landlord upon moving in, certainly caused some confusion in the mind of the Tenant, and I fail to see any fairness in this action at all. Further to this, if there is any question or confusion or misunderstanding in any part of any contract, the party that authored the contract is the person that is responsible. In this case that would be the Landlord.\n  For all of these reasons I find that the Tenant has paid all the monies, and paid them in advance, that he was supposed to pay, to avail himself of the benefit of that promotion. I also find that the Tenant owes the Landlord no monies, not rent, not parking, not costs, and not any reimbursement of monies benefiting the Tenant as a result of that ambiguous wording set out in that contract.     \n      July 27, 2012                                                                    _______________________\nDate Issued                                                                     Wayne MacKinnon\n                                                                                                                           Member, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\nOttawa Ontario K1P6A9\n ", "2012canlii46782": "Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-25052-12\n       \nTAM (the 'Landlord' applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict SGT (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard in Ottawa on July 30, 2012.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, TG, and the Tenant, attended the hearing.\n  The parties agreed that the total amount of the outstanding arrears is $1,069.42, to July 31, 2012.

The Landlord also applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants because the Tenants did not pay the rent that the Tenants owe.\n  These applications were heard together, in Smiths Falls, on July 25, 2012.\n  The Tenants, and the Landlord LD, and the Landlord\u2019s Counsel, DGH, attended the hearing.\n    Determinations:\n  1.      The Tenants have not paid the total rent they were required to pay for the period from May 1, 2012 to July 31, 2012. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective May 31, 2012. The Landlord filed an application on June 28, 2012 to terminate the tenancy and to collect the arrears of rent\n2.      The Tenants had filed an application about tenant rights on May 29, 2012, fully one month before the Landlord filed his application, and the reasons for this application were because the Landlord entered the Tenant\u2019s rental unit illegally, and the landlord and the Landlord\u2019s Counsel had seriously interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit by the Tenants or by members of their household, and had harassed, interfered with and threatened them.  \n3.      There was no dispute about the amount of the rental arrears by the Tenants. In a letter from the Landlord\u2019s Counsel to the Tenants, dated June 15, 2012, the Landlord offered the Tenants an abatement of rent in the amount of $2,450.00 (\u201c\u2026meaning you don\u2019t have to pay May and June\u2019s rent\u2026\u201d) as well as moving costs, not to exceed $610.00, if the Tenants were to move by June 30, 2012. The Landlord had already, at the time of making this initial offer, advertised the Tenant\u2019s unit, for rent, in the issue of a local newspaper, issued on June 7, 2012. When asked by the Member, at the hearing on July 25, 2012, if that offer of an abatement of rent was still available as an option, at this late date, and the Landlord\u2019s Counsel responded in the affirmative. What that means is that the only rent left owing is rent for July, 2012 in the amount of $1,215.00, plus $170.00 in costs for the filing fee, for a total amount of rent owing of $1,385.00.\n4.      With respect to the Tenants\u2019 application, the Tenant alleges that the Landlord (LD) has entered the rental unit on a few different occasions and then proceeded to describe two illegal entries, in detail.\n5.      The Tenant moved into the rental unit on March 1, 2012. Beginning sometime around May 14, 2012, the Tenant brought to the attention of the superintendent that there were bugs/insects of some kind causing bites to the skin of the Tenant and the other members of his household. The Superintendent stated that they were bed bugs and that he too, had an ongoing problem with bed bugs, in his own unit. The Tenant, shortly thereafter, proceeded to a local hospital and saw and spoke with a doctor there who stated that he and his family were being bitten by \u2018bed bugs\u2019.\n6.      Neither the Superintendent, nor the Landlord appeared ready or willing, to take any action to deal with these bed bugs. The Tenant provided evidence, oral, documentary and photographic, to support his allegations of the presence of bed bugs in the rental unit. The Landlord stated that the Tenant must have brought those bugs with him when he moved into the rental unit. It would seem that the bugs would have made an appearance a little earlier in the tenancy if the Tenant had indeed brought them with him upon moving into the rental unit on March 1, 2012, and also that would not explain the infestation in the super\u2019s unit. Notwithstanding all of that, the Landlord would not take any action to try and rid the unit of bed bugs.\n7.      The Landlord had discovered somehow that the Tenant had a criminal record, and had shared this information with some of the other tenants in the rental complex, in a bid to cause friction and problems between the Tenant and his neighbours. The Landlord began to make it clearer that he wanted the Tenant to go, to move out of this complex. Besides the failure to do anything about the bed bugs and, the illegal entries by the Landlord, and also by attempting to entice him to vacate the rental unit with a monetary offer, the Landlord acted somewhat out of character by waiting around the Tenant\u2019s rental unit, and taking pictures of the Tenants and their five children, and also threatening the Tenant, mostly by stating that he would be evicted at any given time.\n8.      There are other issues in this tenancy which should have been brought forward in a proper way (relevant and proper applications), such as mushrooms growing in the door way of the rental unit, trenches dug in the back yard which proved a hazard for children playing in the yard, etc.\n9.      What was interesting is that neither the Landlord nor his Counsel made any effort to disprove or deny most of the above noted evidence provided by the Tenants. There was practically no dispute on the part of the Landlord at all. Based on all of the disclosed evidence at the hearing, and based on a balance of probabilities, I find that the Landlord or the Landlord's superintendent or the Landlord's agent harassed, threatened and interfered with the Tenants, entered the rental unit illegally and substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment of the rental unit or residential complex by the Tenants or by a member of their household.\n10.   The Tenant has requested that the Board order the Landlord to pay compensation for toys and other belongings of the children that the Landlord simply buried in the back yard in those trenches that were dug for the kennels. The Landlord did not provide any evidence of those things ever existing or evidence that would provide replacement or repair costs or estimates of same. No monies will be awarded in this instance, as a result of that lack of evidence.\n11.   The Tenant had already vacated the rental based on an undertaking from the Courts that he would reside with his surety, and not go to the rental premises, except for a sole trip to the premises to gather together his personal belongings and those of his family and move them out of the rental unit. The Tenant will be able to make that sole trip to pick up his belongings accompanied by a peace officer from the Ontario Provincial Police Force.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.      In accordance with the Court undertaking with respect to this Tenant, the Tenant shall be entitled to arrange with the OPP for an escort, to be able to pick up his personal belongings from this rental unit, on Friday, July 27, 2012, between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. The Landlord shall refrain from any interference at all in the execution of this arrangement.\n2.      The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenants was terminated as of July 27, 2012.\n3.      The Tenants shall pay to the Landlord $1,385.00, which amount represents the amount owing for arrears of rent, and costs. The former amount for May and June, 2012, was waived by the Landlord\u2019s Counsel. \n4.      The Landlord shall pay to the Tenant $1,200.00, which amount represents an abatement of rent for the months of April, May, June and July, 2012, at 25% per month for those four months. This amount was awarded due to the illegal entries by the Landlord, and for his inaction with respect to the issue of the bed bugs in the rental unit.\n5.      The Landlord shall also pay to the Tenants $610.00 which is the reasonable out of pocket expenses the Tenants have incurred for moving costs.  \n6.      The total amount the Landlord owes to the Tenants is $1,810.00.\n7.      The Landlord or the Tenant shall pay any monies owing to one or the other, on or before   August 18, 2012. The Landlord may subtract the arrears payment owing ($1,385.00) from the abatement and moving costs awarded.\n8.      If the Landlord does not pay the Tenants the full amount owing by August 18, 2012, he will owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from August 19, 2012 at 3.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n9.      If the unit is not vacated on or before July 27, 2012, then starting July 28, 2012, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n10.
