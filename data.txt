There was no record of a request to adjourn the hearing. As a result, the hearing proceeded with only the Landlord's evidence.\n  Determinations: \n1.         As explained below, the Landlord has proven on a balance of probabilities the grounds for termination of the tenancy the application. Therefore, the tenancy is terminated as of May 23, 2023.\n2.         The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.\n  File Number: LTB-L-076368-22\n    3.         On October 15, 2021, the Landlord gave the Tenant an N7 notice of termination The notice alleges that the Tenant substantially interfered by threatening and harassing other tenants on multiple different dates. It also alleges the Tenant is the source of loud noise and racist language, as well as interrupting or interfering with other tenants\u2019 sleep.  \n  4.         The Landlord provided multiple letters from five other tenants that supported and documented threats and verbal and physical abuse to themselves and their pets. I accept this hearsay evidence, which went unchallenged, and find that:\n-On October 15, 2021 the Tenant harassed, verbally abused and threatening to kill his housemate.\n-On October 12, 2021 the Tenant harassed his neighbour and frightened him. \n-On October 11, the Tenant continued to make loud noises in his unit and disturbed other tenants in the residential complex. \n5.         I find that the Landlord has proved beyond the balance of probabilities that the Tenant impaired the safety of the Landlord and other tenants in the residential complex. \n6.         The Landlord incurred costs of $186.00 for filing the application and is entitled to reimbursement of those costs.\n7.         There is no last month's rent deposit.\n8.

On August 25, 2021, the Landlord gave the Tenant an N5 notice of termination. The notice of termination contains the following allegations: The Tenant has piled garbage on the balcony leading to \u201chorrific smells\u201d and a \u201cstink\u201d that permeates through the entire residential complex and substantially interferes with the Landlord and other tenants\u2019 rights in the residential complex. \n  File Number: LTB-L-076371-22(EAL-98422-21)\n  2.        I accept the Landlord\u2019s evidence that the Tenant did not stop the conduct or activity within seven days after receiving the N5 notice of termination. Therefore, the Tenant did not void the N5 notice of termination in accordance with s.64(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \u2018Act\u2019). \n3.        As explained below, the Landlord has proven on a balance of probabilities the grounds for termination of the tenancy the claim for compensation in the application.\n4.        The Landlord testified and provided the Board with photographs of garbage piled on the Tenant\u2019s balcony from the period of December 2020 to today\u2019s date. The Landlord\u2019s attempts to discuss the issue with the Tenant have been met with no response or slammed doors.  \n5.

The Landlord seek $1000.00 in damages to clean the balcony and replace a damaged wall installed hand sanitizer that the Tenant broke.  \n7.

Therefore, the tenancy is terminated and the Tenant must pay $1000.00 in damages to clean the garbage and replace the broken wall hand sanitizer.\n9.        The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed. \n10.

Your new file number is LTB-L-073444-22.\n  Homestead Land Holdings Limited (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Virginia Larsson (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes.\n  This application was heard by videoconference on October 26, 2022.\n  The Landlord\u2019s representative, Kimberly Adams, the Tenant, and the Tenant\u2019s representative, John Done attended the hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from June 1, 2021 to October 31, 2022. Because of the arrears, the Landlord served a Notice of Termination effective August 6, 2021.\n  2.     The Landlord collected a rent deposit of $1,427.66 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlord.\n  3.     The Tenant paid $14,490.00 after the application was filed.\n  4.     The Tenant\u2019s representative took the position that the Landlord is holding a last month\u2019s rent deposit that is greater than the current rent amount. The Landlord\u2019s representative told the Board that the rent decreased as a result of cancelling the cost of storage and that represents the amount still being held by the Landlord. I find that this is not grounds\n\n  to dismiss the Landlord\u2019s application. The Tenant can seek to resolve this by filing her own application with the Board.\n  5.     The Tenant\u2019s representative also submitted that the N4 should be deemed invalid because it fails to set out the amount of rent due pursuant to subsection 59 (2) of the Act. He stated that the N4 misrepresents the rent which the Tenant paid during June and July 2021.\n  6.     At the hearing the Tenant\u2019s representative walked us through the ledger which represented the amount of rent charged, the amount of rent paid and the amount of rent due. While the Landlord may have allocated rent paid to previous arrears, the amount due on the N4 was in fact correct. Base of the information presented to me I find that the N4 served on the Tenant was valid.\n  7.     The Tenant testified that she was impacted by the pandemic and as a result fell behind on her rent payments. She told the Board that she was receiving CERB for a period of time, however, she is now working and intends to pay the outstanding arrears.\n  8.     In giving consideration to the Tenants circumstances, a delayed eviction would be appropriate. However, given the date this order is being issued, the Tenant has already had the benefit of additional time to seek financial assistance and/or alternative housing. Therefore, I find that a standard order is not unfair.\n  9.     I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance with subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.     Unless the Tenant voids the order as set out below, the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before January 21, 2023.\n  2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $7,546.31*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to January 10, 2023, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlord owes on the rent deposit.\n  3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $45.64 per day for compensation for the use of the unit starting January 11, 2023 to the date the Tenant moves out of the unit.\n  4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  5.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing* on or before January 21, 2023, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from January 22, 2023 at 5.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n\n  6.     If the unit is not vacated on or before January 21, 2023, then starting January 22, 2023, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n  7.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord, on or after January 22, 2023.\n  8.     If, on or before January 21, 2023, the Tenant pays the amount of $9,352.70** to the Landlord or to the Board in trust, this order for eviction will be void. This means that the tenancy would not be terminated, and the Tenant could remain in the unit. If this payment is not made in full and on time, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n  9.     The Tenant may make a motion to the Board under subsection 74(11) of the Act to set aside this order if they pay the amount required under that subsection on or after January 22, 2023 but before the Sheriff gives vacant possession to the Landlord. The Tenant is only entitled to make this motion once during the period of the tenancy agreement with the Landlord.\n      January 10, 2023 Date Issued\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n    If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.\n  In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on July 22, 2023 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.\n  *           Refer to section A on the attached Summary of Calculations.\n**         Refer to section B on the attached Summary of Calculations.\n\nSchedule 1 SUMMARY OF CALCULATIONS\n  File Number: EAL-98572-21\n  A.

The Landlord also claimed compensation for each day the Tenants remained in the unit after the termination date.\n  This application was resolved by order EAL-95828-21 issued on November 23, 2021. On December 23, 20221, the Landlord requested a review of the order.\nOn March 4, 2022, the Board heard the Landlord\u2019s request for review. On this date, only the Landlord attend the hearing. The Tenants did not attend and were not represented.\n  On May 10, 2022, the Board issued order EAL-95828-21-RV granting the Landlord\u2019s request for review and their L2 application.\n  On June 8, 2022, the Tenants filed a request to review the order EAL-95828-21-RV alleging they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing and that the order contains serious error.\n  A preliminary review of the review request was completed without a hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  Were the Tenants reasonably able to participate in the hearing?\n  1.        In the request, the Tenants submit that they did not attend the hearing because they were told by Tenant Duty Counsel that they did not have to attend. The Tenants submit that\n\n  Tenant Duty Counsel told them this because the Landlord\u2019s application was for eviction and the Tenants had already vacated the rental unit.\n  2.        The Tenants\u2019 submissions clearly indicate that they were aware of the Board hearing, and they chose not to attend. The Tenants claim they did not attend the hearing because of legal advice they received, despite indicating in their request to review that they had issues they wanted addressed at the hearing. The fact the Tenants may not have received good legal advice with respect to their attendance at the hearing is not an error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding. Neither is it a reason for not being reasonably able to participate in the hearing.\n  3.        Based on the submissions in the request, I am satisfied the Tenants were reasonably able to participate in the hearing. I say this because the Tenants confirm knowing about the hearing and did not attend. In my view, this demonstrates a lack of due diligence on the part of the Tenants. A lack of exercising due diligence is not a reason for which a request to review an order would be granted. My findings are in keeping with the guidance of the Court in Q Res IV Operating GP Inc. v. Berezovs\u2019ka, 2017 ONSC 5541 CanLII (Div. Ct.) paragraph 8 which states:\n  If parties are not diligent in dealing with legal proceedings then they cannot demand that a Tribunal waste its resources by rehearing matters a second time. To allow this would undermine the ability of the administration of justice to deliver timely, cost-effective and final orders.\n  4.        Based on the above, the Tenants are not entitled to have the Landlord\u2019s application re- heard because they failed to exercise due diligence. Therefore, the request to review based on the Tenants\u2019 allegation that they were not reasonably able to participate in the hearing, is denied.\n  Is there a serious error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding?\n  5.        In the request, the Tenants make submissions in support of their position with respect to the Landlord\u2019s application. The Tenants allege the Member made their decision based on misleading evidence and lies submitted by the Landlord. The Tenants further alleged that the Landlord never paid them compensation equal to one month\u2019s rent as required for having served them an N12 Notice of Termination (\u2018N12 notice\u2019).\n  6.        I have reviewed the Board\u2019s record and the order. In doing so, I note that in the Landlord\u2019s evidence package there is supporting documentation that compensation was paid to the Tenants with respect to the N12 notice. If the Tenants wanted to challenge the Landlord\u2019s evidence on this point, then the Tenants should have attended the hearing to give their evidence on the issue.\n  7.        With respect to the Tenants submitting the Landlord mislead or lied to the Board, the opportunity for the Tenants to challenge the veracity of the Landlord\u2019s evidence was at the hearing and not in a request to review the order.\n\n  8.        A request to review is not an opportunity for a party to re-litigate or reargue their position in hopes of a more favorable outcome. Nor is it an opportunity to present evidence and submissions that could and should have been presented at the hearing.\n  9.        In the request to review, the Tenants do not identify any serious error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding. Given my finding, the Tenants\u2019 request to review the order, on the grounds of serious error in the order or in the Board\u2019s proceeding, is denied.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.

As of 10:23 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented although properly served with a notice of hearing by the Board.\n\n        Determinations:\n  L2 application: substantial interference, illegal act, and serious impairment of safety\n  1.     The residential complex is an apartment building.\n  2.     The Landlords served a Notice to End Your Tenancy for Interfering With others, Damage, or Overcrowding (\u2018N5 notice\u2019) and a Notice to End Your Tenancy for Illegal Acts (\u2018N6 notice\u2019) on the Tenant on August 03, 2021 by handling the documents to an adult person in the unit.\n  3.     The Landlords served a Notice to End your Tenancy for Causing Serious Problems in the Rental Unit or Residential Complex (\u2018N7 notice\u2019) on the Tenant on August 03, 2021 by handling the documents to an adult person in the unit.\n  Evidence pertaining to the allegations in the N5 and N6:\n  4.     The N5 notice alleged that the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlords\u2019 reasonable enjoyment of the premises. The N6 notice alleged that the Tenant engaged in illegal acts on the premises. The grounds for the N5 and N6 notices together with evidence adduced at the hearing included:\n  \u2022         Excessive noise from Tenant\u2019s guests, yelling and banging on the evening of July 08, 2021 and July 16, 2021.\n  \u2022         On June 23, 2020 a unit inspection found damages to the parquet flooring, missing bathroom door, kitchen doors, and broken vanity door.\n  \u2022         On April 14, 2020, a photograph evidence of the lobby showed the Tenant removing a delivered parcel which was later reported as stolen as it belongs to another tenant\n  \u2022         On July 8, 2021 a crack pipe was found outside Tenant\u2019s unit door, bag found outside the apartment door in the building hallway containing drug paraphernalia. The Police was called, and the bag was secured with a police report completed accordingly\n  5.     K.K., a HomePro Pest Control technician, testified at the hearing as a witness for the Landlord. K.K testified that on May 13, 2021 and June 18, 2021, he attended the complex to treat the unit for cockroaches. K.K testified that he was unable to treat the unit due to extreme sanitation issues.\n  6.     K.K testified that the unit was infested with cockroaches due to extreme sanitation issues. He testified that the unit was poorly managed with clothes and injection needles on floor.\n\n  As a result of the state of the unit, pest control treatments could not be carried out on that day. The photographic evidence is entirely consistent with K.K testimony.\n  7.     The N5 notice gave the Tenant an opportunity to void the notice by ceasing all her conducts complained of in the notice in the seven days after the notice was served; so, the voiding period was from August 26 to September 01, 2021.\n  8.     The N7 notice alleged that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety of another person and substantially interfered with the Landlords\u2019 reasonable enjoyment of the premises. The grounds for the N7 notice along with evidence adduced at the hearing included:\n  \u2022         All of the grounds set out in the N5 and N6 notices.\n\u2022         On July 17, 2021 Tenant\u2019s guest harassed tenant for not allowing them to gain access to the building.\n\u2022         Tenant approached tenant on July 18, 2021 for not letting her guests into the building\nLegislation and Analysis:\n  The L2/N5 Application - Tenant has Substantially Interfered with the Landlord\n  9.     The N5 notice was served pursuant to sections 62 and 64 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (\u2018the Act\u2019). Section 62 sets out that a landlord can give a notice of termination if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a guest of the tenant wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit.\n  10.  Section 64 sets out that a landlord can give a notice of termination if the conduct of the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.\n  11.  The Tenant has an obligation under section 33 of the Act to maintain the rental unit in a state of \u201cordinary cleanliness\u201d.\n  12.  I accept the uncontested testimony of the Landlord\u2019s witness Deanna Blackwood and find that the Landlord proved, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant has substantially\ninterfered with the Landlord\u2019s lawful rights, privileges and interests by failing to maintain the rental unit in a state of ordinary cleanliness, such that the Landlord\u2019s was unable to perform necessary pest control treatments.\n  13.  I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Tenant did not void the substantial interference claim or the damages claim set out in the N5 notice. The state of the Tenant\u2019s unit showed little or no improvement when the Landlord re-inspected it on September 01, 2021, the last day of the void period and to date the unit is not in a state of ordinary cleanliness. Therefore, the Landlord was entitled to file the L2 application for eviction of the Tenant.\n\n      14.  Regarding Tenant\u2019s alleged stealing delivered package from the lobby, yelling, and harassing tenant for denying her guest building entrance, there was no evidence establishing that the alleged acts seriously impaired the safety of any person.\n  15.  Re File No. TSL-19235-11, 2011 LNONLTB 2109 (Ont. L.T.B.) illustrates the strict requirement under Section 66 of the Act. In that matter, the Board held that threats made to a security guard did not constitute serious impairment of safety. In paragraph 12, the Board stated: \u201cVerbal harassment and threats alone rarely constitute a serious impairment of safety to another person\u201d.\n  16.  In Re File No. SWL-35940 [2002] O.R.H.T.D. No. 146 (O.R.H.T.), the Board held the\ntenant\u2019s actions, i.e., swearing at the landlord and acting inappropriately, while they made the landlord afraid, did not constitute serious impairment of safety. The adjudicator stated that any impairment of safety must be serious, and the Act was not intended to legislate good manners.\n  17.  In File No. SWL-01073, [1998] OR.H.T.D. No. 18, the Tribunal held that while many of the other tenant felt intimidated by the tenant, there was no objective evidence that anyone\u2019s safety was in real jeopardy. The Tribunal held that subjective fear was insufficient.\n  18.  In this case here, the Landlord asserted that on July 17 and 18, 2021, the Tenant swore at Tenants when they denied her guests access into the building. As illustrated in the abovementioned cases, the Tenant\u2019s actions on these dates do not \u201cconstitute serious impairment of other Tenants\u2019 safety\u201d.\n  19.  The Landlord did not meet the burden of proof. I am not satisfied that the Tenant seriously impaired the safety of another person or that they wilfully caused undue damage to the residential complex.\n  The L2/N6 Application\n  20.  Section 61(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') provides as follows:\n  61 (1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant or another occupant of the rental unit commits an illegal act or carries on an illegal trade, business or occupation or permits a person to do so in the rental unit or the residential complex.\n  21.  The Board\u2019s Interpretation Guideline 9 states that while the term illegal is not defined in the Act, it would include a serious violation of a federal, provincial or municipal law. This guideline also states that an illegal act will be serious if it has the potential to affect the character of the premises or to disturb the reasonable enjoyment of other tenant (Samuel Property Management Ltd. v. Nicholson 2002 CanLII 45065 (ON CA), 2002 61 O.R. (3d) 470 C.A. at para. 28)\n  22.  The Landlord\u2019s representative testified that the Tenant engaged in illegal acts on the premises as drug paraphernalia and needles were found in her unit, a crack pipe was\n\n  found outside of the unit door, and a bag of drug paraphernalia was also found outside the unit door. This was supported by photographic and documentary evidence.\n  23.  Despite these assertions, the Landlord\u2019s representative did not lead any satisfactory evidence to establish that the alleged illegal acts by the Tenant was for the purpose of trafficking contrary to section 61 of the RTA. Drug paraphernalia may be indicative of drug use, it does not automatically lead to a finding that Tenant or someone living with the Tenant has committed an illegal act or is carrying on an illegal business at the residential complex.\n  The L2/N7 Application - Serious Impairment of Safety\n  24.  Section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the \u201cAct\u201d), establishes the \u201cimpairment of safety\u201d ground for termination. That provision states:\n  A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if,\n  (a)   An act or omission of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant seriously impairs or has seriously impaired the safety of any person; and\n  (b)   The act or omission occurs in the residential complex.\n  25.  Based on the Landlord\u2019s evidence, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the behaviour of Tenant meets the elements of section 66 of the Act.\n  Damage\n  26.  Subsection 89(1) of the Act gives the Board the authority to award a landlord damages. It provides as follows\n  \u201cA landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property, if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex and the tenant is in possession of the rental unit\u201d.\n  27.  The Landlord relied upon an assessment provided by a contractor. He suggested to the Landlord the following:\n  \u2022         Install the missing Hardwood floors at the cost of $2,320.\n\u2022         Replace the Bathroom door at the cost of $225.00\n\u2022         Replace missing Kitchen and vanity doors at $780.00\n\u2022         Patch and Paint bathroom Ceiling at the cost of $600.00\n\n  28.  The photographs taken by the Landlord and submitted into evidence show missing wood to the hardwood floors, bathroom door, kitchen and vanity door, and bathroom ceiling.\n  29.  Given all these factors concerning the condition of the unit, I find that the evidence of the professional assessment of damages to the parquet flooring, missing bathroom door, kitchen doors, windows, and broken vanity door can be reasonably repaired and replaced at the cost of $4,435.25 (Total cost of work $3925.00 + HST of $510.25).\n  Section 83 Considerations\n  30.  The Board must determine whether, notwithstanding the breaches of the Act, it would be unfair in all the circumstances to grant relief from eviction.\n  31.  The Landlord requested a standard 11-day order terminating the tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant, and evicting the Tenant, due to the extent of the damage caused to the rental unit and because the Tenant substantially interfered with the Landlord\u2019s rights, privileges and interests. The Landlord testified that she is unaware of any circumstances of the Tenant that would cause me to delay or deny eviction of the Tenant.\n  32.  The Tenant did not attend the hearing to provide evidence regarding their circumstances and therefore there is no evidence before the Board for consideration.\n  33.  I have considered all of the disclosed circumstances in accordance\nwith subsection 83(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), and find that it would be unfair to grant relief from eviction pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the Act as the Tenant did not attend the hearing and there were no circumstances before me that would suggest that termination was unfair in this case.\nIt is ordered that:\n  1.     The tenancy between the Landlord and the Tenant is terminated, as of March 20, 2022. The Tenant must move out of the rental unit on or before March 20, 2022.\n  2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $4,435.25, which represents the contractor\u2019s estimated amount of cost to repair damages to the hardwood floors, bathroom door, kitchen and vanity door, and bathroom ceiling on or before March 20, 2022\n  3.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 20, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 21, 2022, at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n\n  5.     If the unit is not vacated on or before March 20, 2022, then starting March 21, 2022, the Landlord may file this order with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) so that the eviction may be enforced.\n  6.     Upon receipt of this order, the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) is directed to give vacant possession of the unit to the Landlord on or after March 21, 2022.\n      March 09, 2022\nDate Issued                                                                     Percy Laryea\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n    If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.\n  In accordance with section 81 of the Act, the part of this order relating to the eviction expires on June 13, 2022 if the order has not been filed on or before this date with the Court Enforcement Office (Sheriff) that has territorial jurisdiction where the rental unit is located.", "2022canlii137788": "  Order under Section 94\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-98436-21\n    In the matter of:\nB-4, 282 DONALD STREET OTTAWA ON K1K1M7\n  Between:\nJeannette Jarawan\nLandlord\n  and                                                                   \n    Sylvain Lalonde\nTenant\n      Jeannette Jarawan (the 'Landlord') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict Sylvain Lalonde (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the premises; and because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or someone the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has substantially interfered with the reasonable enjoyment or lawful right, privilege or interest of the Landlord or another tenant; because the Tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person the Tenant permitted in the residential complex has seriously impaired the safety of any person.

The Landlord and the Tenants attended the hearing.\nDeterminations:\n  1.     The Landlord served the Tenants a Notice of Termination (N8 Notice) because the Tenants were persistently late in paying their rent.\n  2.     The N8 Notice served upon the Tenants by the Landlord lacks sufficient detail as required by subsection 43(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.\n  3.     The Ontario Divisional Court in Ball v.

The N8 Notice served upon the Tenants does not include the dates when the Tenants allegedly paid their rent late.\n  5.

The order provided that the Landlord could apply to the Board under section 78 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act') without notice to the Tenants to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenants if the Tenants did not meet certain condition(s) specified in the order.\n  2.     I find that the Tenants have not met the following conditions specified in the order: The Tenants did not pay $1950.00 rent on or before February 1, 2022.\n  3.     The previous application included a request for an order for the payment of arrears of rent. The resulting order required the Tenants to pay rent or some or all of the arrears of rent. Accordingly, in addition to eviction, the Landlord is entitled to request an order for the payment of arrears of rent and compensation.\n  4.     The Tenants were ordered to pay $16,925.00 for rent arrears and the costs related to the Landlord's application fee in Order EAL-96834-21.

Pursuant to s.89 of the Act,\n  (1) A landlord may apply to the Board for an order requiring a tenant or former tenant to pay reasonable costs that the landlord has incurred or will incur for the repair of or, where repairing is not reasonable, the replacement of damaged property if,\n\n  (a) while the tenant or former tenant is or was in possession of the rental unit, the tenant or former tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant or former tenant wilfully or negligently causes or caused undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex;\n  6.     In order for an application for compensation for damages made pursuant to subsection 89\n  (1)   of the Act to succeed, a landlord must establish the following:\na)  There was property damage to the rental unit or residential complex;\nb)  The damage is \u201cundue\u201d meaning that it is not normal wear and tear and it is not insignificant; and\nc)  The damage was a result of wilful or negligent conduct by the Tenant, occupant or guest.\n  7.     If all of these factors are met, then the Board can award the Landlord\u2019s the reasonable cost of repair, or the replacement cost if it is not reasonable for the damage to be repaired.\n  8.     Not all types of damage that may occur in a rental unit or residential complex will meet the test or requirement of section 89 of the Act.\n  9.     Some damage may not have any element of wilfulness or negligence and a landlord, as the property owner, will have to bear the cost of repairing that damage.\n  10.  Section 89 is clear and a plain language reading of the section establishes that the Tenant must have wilfully or negligently caused the damage.\n  11.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative said the Tenant was provided with a copy of the L2 application and details of the charge back. Submitted into evidence was an email dated November 9, 2020 where the Landlord writes to the Tenant about an exit inspection prior to the termination of tenancy and noting \u201cquite a bit of damage incurred inside of the unit that is not the result of wear and tear. Rather it is the result of the wilful negligent conduct of yourself and or/your guest.\u201d A reply to the email from the Tenant to the Landlord on November 12, 2020 states \u201cI will speak to my Ontario works worker.\u201d\n  12.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative reviewed sections 25 and 26 of the Lease as they pertain to the Tenant\u2019s obligation to maintain the unit in a good state of repair. Section J pertains to the Tenant(s) and/or guest(s) responsibility not to damage the unit wilfully or negligently. This was provided to the Tenant as per the November 9, 2020 email in paragraph 9. A copy of the Lease was submitted as evidence.\n  13.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative reviewed the before and after photos taken prior to tenancy and post tenancy as submitted into evidence.\n\n  14.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative argued that the Tenant, as a pre-condition to tenancy, signed an Incoming/Outgoing Residents Inspection Report on or about April 3, 2019. Submitted into evidence was a copy of the report and photos of the rental unit prior to the Tenant moving in. Also submitted into evidence was a list of the charge back costs should damage occur.\n  15.  In the L2 application, the Landlord is seeking $3899.31 as the cost to repair or replace the damaged property.\n  16.  On the date of the hearing, the Landlord\u2019s Representative, upon review of the evidence, requested to amend the application to include; the application filing fee, cost to replace the countertop and the cost to repair/replace the baseboard and flooring and painting. As detailed below, the revised total is significantly less than what was filed with the L2 application.\n  Kitchen Countertop\n  17.  The Landlord\u2019s Representative said that the counter tops had cut marks throughout the kitchen and that it was necessary to replace them at a cost of $300.00. Submitted as evidence was the Home Depot Invoice with a total cost for the countertop of $172.00. The Landlord believes it is reasonable for the Tenant to compensation the Landlord for the total cost of the countertop.\n  18.  Based on the evidence before me, I find that it is reasonable that the Tenant compensate the Landlord in the amount of $172.00 for the cost to replace the damaged counter tops. I find it is more likely than not that it was a result of negligence on the part of the Tenant that resulted in the damage to the countertop.\n  Flooring and Baseboards\n  19.  It was the position of the Landlord that the Tenant caused damage to the laminate flooring in the living room and dinning room and is seeking $2865.27 for replacement costs. The Landlord claims that the floors need to be replaced due to scratches and that all the floors need to be replaced for consistency throughout the rental unit. Additionally, the baseboards were damaged, possibly caused by the Tenant\u2019s rabbit, scratching and chewing and relieving itself in the unit. Before and after photos of the flooring and baseboards were submitted into evidence. The Landlord is seeking $650.00 for the area damaged to the flooring and baseboards for which the Tenant is responsible.\n  20.  Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I find the damage to the laminate flooring and baseboards to be undue property damage not a result of normal wear-an-tear. By allowing the Tenant\u2019s pet to relieve itself and scratch the flooring and baseboards in the\n\n  rental unit causing damage to the floor and baseboards, the Tenant has exhibited negligent conduct.\n  21.  Furthermore, I find that the quote of $650.00 to replace the flooring and baseboards for that section of the room where there is damage to be reasonable and this amount shall be awarded.\n  Paint\n  22.  The Landlord is seeking $297.08 for the cost of paint to repair the baseboards. The Sherwin-Williams invoice was submitted as evidence. When I questioned the Landlord\u2019s Representative on the cost of the baseboard paint, based on my experience, she suggested 25% of the total invoice as a reasonable cost to the Tenant. Accordingly, I find\n$74.27 to be a reasonable cost for paint to repair the area of baseboard damaged as a result of the Tenant\u2019s negligence.\n  23.  Based on the uncontested evidence before me, I am satisfied that the damages to the rental unit as described in paragraphs 17 to 22 is a result of the Tenant\u2019s wilful and/or negligent conduct. I say this based on the photographs presented by the Landlord that suggest damage beyond normal wear-and-tear. The Landlord\u2019s claim will be granted.\n  24.  This order contains all of the reasons for the decision within it. No further reasons shall be issued.\nIt is ordered that:\n  1.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord $896.27, which represents the reasonable costs of repairing the damage to the large section of flooring, baseboards and countertop.\n  2.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlord $186.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  3.     The total amount owing under this order is $1082.27.\n  4.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlord the full amount owing on or before March 31, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from April 1, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n  March 8, 2022\nDate Issued                                                                     Dana Wren\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\n  Eastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor\n\n  Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n    If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.", "2022canlii137882": "  Order under Section 69\nResidential Tenancies Act, 2006\n  File Number: EAL-87949-19\n  In the matter of:\nxxx\n  Between:\nRB\nJB\nLandlords\n  and\n    HM\nTenant\n    RB and JB (the 'Landlords') applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict HM (the 'Tenant') because the Tenant did not pay the rent that the Tenant owes (L1 application).\n  The Landlords applied for an order to terminate the tenancy and evict the Tenant because the Tenant has been persistently late in paying the Tenant's rent. The Landlord also applied for an order for the Tenant to compensate the Landlords for undue damage to the rental unit (L2 application).\n  This application was heard via video conference on June 23, 2021. Only the Landlords attended the hearing.\nAt 9:23 a.m. the Tenant was not present or represented at the hearing.\n  Determinations:\n  L1 application:\n  1.     The Tenant has not paid the total rent the Tenant was required to pay for the period from December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020. Because of the arrears, the Landlords served a Notice of Termination effective December 16, 2019.\n  2.     The Tenant vacated the rental unit on February 14, 2020. The Tenant was in possession of the rental unit on the date the application was filed.\n  3.     The monthly rent was $1,175.00.\n  4.     The Tenant made no payments towards the rent after the application was filed.\n  5.     At the hearing, the Landlords acknowledged that there were clerical errors on the L1 update form submitted to the Board. Specifically, that new rent came due for January 1,\n\n  2020 and February 1, 2020 and not 2021. In addition, the filing fee cost was $190.00 and not $186.00.\n  6.     The Landlords collected a rent deposit of $1,175.00 from the Tenant and this deposit is still being held by the Landlords.\n  7.     Interest on the rent deposit is owing to the Tenant for the period from November 4, 2018 to December 16, 2019.\n  L2 application: Form N8 \u2013 Persistent Late Payment of Rent\n  8.     The Tenant vacated the unit. As a result, the hearing of the application to terminate the tenancy for persistent late payment of rent, is moot.\n  9.     At the hearing, the Landlords requested the consent of the Board to withdraw their application.\n  10.  In accordance with subsection 200(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 (the 'Act'), I consent to the withdrawal of the application.\n  L2 application: Damages\n  11.  The Landlord\u2019s L2 application for damages was amended to increase the compensation sought from $372.90 to $429.40. The amendment was granted as the Landlords provided the amended application to the Tenant prior to the hearing.\n  12.  The issue to be determined by the Board is whether the Tenant has wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit.\n  13.  The residential property is a two-storey house, with two bedrooms. The Tenant rented the entire house.\n  14.  The Landlords testified that the Tenant caused undue damage to a bedroom window. The Landlords stated that they were told by the Tenant that the Tenant\u2019s son was playing ball in the bedroom and broke the window\u2019s glass pane.\n  15.  The Landlords submitted into evidence photographs taken of the broken glass window.\n  16.  The Landlords testified that the window\u2019s glass could no be replaced, rather they had to replace the entire window, as it was less expensive to do so.\n  17.  The Landlords purchased and installed the new window. The Landlords claims the cost of the window was $380.00, plus $49.40 tax, for the total of $429.40.\n  18.  To be successful on a claim for damages the Landlords must prove on a balance of probabilities that the damage claimed is \u201cundue\u201d. There is no definition in the Act of \u201cundue\u201d, but it is fair to say that it means \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d or \u201cnot wear and tear caused by ordinary usage.\u201d The Landlords must also establish that the Tenant, wilfully or\n\n  negligently caused the damage. If the Landlords establishes undue damage which was caused wilfully or negligently then the Landlords must lead sufficient evidence to show what the reasonable cost to repair or replace.\n  19.  Based on the uncontested before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Tenant, or an occupant of the unit, wilfully or negligently caused undue damage to the rental unit. The Tenant\u2019s son caused the window\u2019s glass to break when he was playing with a ball in the bedroom.\n  20.  I find that the Landlords incurred the costs of $429.40 to replace the entire window and this is a reasonable cost.\n  It is ordered that:\n  1.     The tenancy between the Landlords and the Tenant is terminated as of February 14, 2020, the date the Tenant gave vacant possession of the rental unit to the Landlords.\n  2.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords $1,737.26*, which represents the amount of rent owing and compensation up to February 14, 2020, less the rent deposit and interest the Landlords owe on the rent deposit.\n  3.     The Tenant shall pay to the Landlords the amount of $429.40, which represents the reasonable cost incurred of replacing the damaged property.\n  4.     The Tenant shall also pay to the Landlords $190.00 for the cost of filing the application.\n  5.     The Tenant owes to the Landlords the total of $2,356.66.\n  6.     If the Tenant does not pay the Landlords the full amount owing of $2,356.66 on or before March 18, 2022, the Tenant will start to owe interest. This will be simple interest calculated from March 19, 2022 at 2.00% annually on the balance outstanding.\n  7.     The L2 application based on persistent late payment of rent is dismissed.\n    March 7, 2022                                                                 \n Date Issued                                                                     Debbie Mosaheb\nMember, Landlord and Tenant Board\nEastern-RO\n255 Albert Street, 4th Floor Ottawa ON K1P6A9\n  If you have any questions about this order, call 416-645-8080 or toll free at 1-888-332-3234.\n  *         Refer to section A on the attached Summary of Calculations.\n\nSchedule 1 SUMMARY OF CALCULATIONS\n  File Number: EAL-87949-19\n    A.
